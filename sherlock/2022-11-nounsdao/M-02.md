# Allow payer to recover tokens sent in excess

## Summary

Provide a mechanism to the payer to recover funds sent in excess to the `Stream` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the payer funds in excess the stream (i.e. sends more than `tokenAmount()`) there's currently no way to recover those funds unless the stream is canceled. 

## Impact

To recover those funds the payer needs to either cancel the stream or wait until the end of the stream. The `recoverERC20` function will only work for tokens different from the stream token.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-nounsdao-romeroadrian/blob/main/src/Stream.sol#L268

```solidity
function rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyPayer {
      if (tokenAddress == address(token())) revert CannotRescueStreamToken();

      IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `rescueERC20` can be slightly modified to also allow recovering funds sent in excess of the stream token, which can be identified by comparing the contract's balance and the `remainingBalance` variable. Here's an idea:

```solidity
function rescueERC20(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) external onlyPayer {
    IERC20 token_ = token();

    if (tokenAddress == address(token_)) {
      uint256 tokenBalance_ = tokenBalance();
      uint256 remainingBalance_ = remainingBalance;
      
      if (tokenBalance_ > remainingBalance_) {
        uint256 maxAllowed = tokenBalance_ - remainingBalance_;
        token_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount > maxAllowed ? maxAllowed : amount);
      }
    } else {
      IERC20(tokenAddress).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```
