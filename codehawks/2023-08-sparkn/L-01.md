# Use Ownable2Step instead of Ownable for access control 

## Summary

Use the [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) variant of the Ownable contract to better safeguard against accidental transfers of access control.

## Vulnerability Details

The ProxyFactory.sol contract [inherits from Ownable](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-08-sparkn/blob/47c22b818818af4ea7388118dd83fa308ad67b83/src/ProxyFactory.sol#L37).

## Impact

Low. Ownership can be accidentally transferred to the wrong address.

## Tools Used

None.

## Recommendations

Use a two step process to transfer contract ownership, such as [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) from the OpenZeppelin contracts library.
