# ERC20 with blacklisting feature could block assets

## Summary

Any wallet blacklisted will block the distribute process. E.g. USDC and USDT use this feature.

## Vulnerability Details

Even though the contract uses `safeTransfer` to send the tokens to the winner, this function will revert if the recipient is blacklisted. In this case that address can be removed from the winner list, an the issue will be solved. But, in a worst case scenario, if the `STADIUM_ADDRESS` is blacklisted, the whole distribution process will be blocked for ever.

## Impact

Probability: Low. Is not likely that the `STADIUM_ADDRESS` is blacklisted.
Severity: High. The distribution process would be blocked irreversibly.

## Recommendations

Make `STADIUM_ADDRESS` a parameter of the distribution function, so it can be changed in case of emergency.
