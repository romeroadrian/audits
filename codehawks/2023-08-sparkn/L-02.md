# Libraries are broken

## Summary

The project's libraries are missing. Project doesn't compile. Additionally, it is impossible to know which library versions are intended to be used and whether these contain known bugs or vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Details

Both [Distributor.sol](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-08-sparkn/blob/main/src/Distributor.sol#L26-L27) and [ProxyFactory.sol](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2023-08-sparkn/blob/main/src/ProxyFactory.sol#L26-L28) expect to use the OpenZeppelin contracts library. 

## Impact

Low. Project doesn't compile. Impossible to know what version of the libraries are intended to be used.

## Tools Used

None.

## Recommendations

Add libraries as git submodules or use a dependency manager such as npm. In both cases, always link to a specific revision or tag to know which version of the libraries are used.
