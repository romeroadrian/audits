# Immutable configuration in factory contract

## Summary

The configuration settings for the ProxyFactory.sol contract cannot be changed, forcing a redeploy in case the configuration needs to be tweaked.

## Vulnerability Details

Unlike the Distributor contract, whose implementation can be changed later for future contests, the factory contract is a non-upgradeable singleton contract that serves as the main entrypoint of the protocol. This contract contains a set of configuration variables that are defined at construction time and cannot be changed during the lifetime of the contract. Both `EXPIRATION_TIME` and `MAX_CONTEST_PERIOD` are constant variables, and the set of whitelisted tokens present in the `whitelistedTokens` mapping is only defined in the contract's constructor, without providing any mutator to allow future modifications.

If any of these settings needs to be tweaked, it will force a redeployment of the contract, eventually needing to deal with multiple entry points for the protocol.

## Impact

Low. Configuration values are constant and can't be changed if needed.

## Tools Used

None.

## Recommendations

Change the expiration time and max contest period settings to storage variables and allow the owner of the contract to change them via setters. Provide mutators for the `whitelistedTokens` mapping in case the list of supported tokens needs to be expanded.
