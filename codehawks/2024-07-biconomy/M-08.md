# Calldata length is not validated in `fallback()`

## Summary

When calldata is less than 4 bytes long, calls may be incorrectly routed to an unintended fallback handler.

## Vulnerability Details

To determine the matching fallback handler, the `fallback()` function extracts the first 4 bytes of the calldata and looks up the fallback handler by its selector.

```solidity
72:     fallback() external payable override(Receiver) receiverFallback {
73:         FallbackHandler storage $fallbackHandler = _getAccountStorage().fallbacks[msg.sig];
74:         address handler = $fallbackHandler.handler;
75:         CallType calltype = $fallbackHandler.calltype;
76:         require(handler != address(0), MissingFallbackHandler(msg.sig));
```

The implementation uses `msg.sig`, which returns the first 4 bytes of the calldata, according to [Solidity's documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html#block-and-transaction-properties).

> msg.sig (bytes4): first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)

However, the function doesn't validate that the calldata is at least 4 bytes long. When calldata is shorter than 4 bytes, `msg.sig` wil pad the missing bytes with zeros.

## Impact

Calls may be incorrectly routed to an unintended fallback handler when calldata is shorter than 4 bytes.

## Tools Used

None.

## Recommendations

Ensure that the calldata length is at least 4 bytes.

```diff
    fallback() external payable override(Receiver) receiverFallback {
+       require(msg.data.length >= 4);
        FallbackHandler storage $fallbackHandler = _getAccountStorage().fallbacks[msg.sig];
```
