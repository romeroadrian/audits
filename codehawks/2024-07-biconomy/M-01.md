# Typehash for ModuleEnableMode struct is incorrect

## Summary

There are two different errors in the typehash for the ModuleEnableMode structure, resulting in incompatibility with the EIP-712 standard.

## Vulnerability Details

The typehash for the ModuleEnableMode structure is defined in the `MODULE_ENABLE_MODE_TYPE_HASH` constant as the following:

```solidity
41: bytes32 constant MODULE_ENABLE_MODE_TYPE_HASH = keccak256("ModuleEnableMode(address module, bytes32 initDataHash)");
```

The first error is the blank space after the first comma between the members. According to the [EIP-712 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), members are joined by a "," without any blank space.

> The type of a struct is encoded as name ‖ "(" ‖ member₁ ‖ "," ‖ member₂ ‖ "," ‖ … ‖ memberₙ ")" where each member is written as type ‖ " " ‖ name. For example, the above Mail struct is encoded as Mail(address from,address to,string contents).

The added space completely changes the result of the typehash:

```solidity
keccak256("ModuleEnableMode(address module, bytes32 initDataHash)") => 0x9f34cc46003dee27a148c367555bac140aa3fbfc713cf44b3842f343fc2a4e7b
keccak256("ModuleEnableMode(address module,bytes32 initDataHash)")  => 0xe81b75314ee7a02a1f49592b5a66846e18745ee8948ef8f98f4649864a3f701e
```

There is another error in the data types, the typehash is used in the `_getEnableModeDataHash()` function:

```solidity
388:     function _getEnableModeDataHash(address module, bytes calldata initData) internal view returns (bytes32 digest) {
389:         digest = _hashTypedData(
390:             keccak256(
391:                 abi.encode(
392:                     MODULE_ENABLE_MODE_TYPE_HASH,
393:                     module,
394:                     keccak256(initData)
395:                 )
396:             )
397:         );
398:     }
```

As we can see in the code snippet, the second argument, `initDataHash`, is of type `bytes` while the typehash defined it as `bytes32`.

## Impact

Both errors will lead to an incompatibility with the EIP-712 standard. Existing tools and signing devices that implement EIP-712 will produce signatures that will be rejected due to these small errors even if the signer is valid.

## Tools Used

None.

## Recommendations

Change the typehash to:

```solidity
bytes32 constant MODULE_ENABLE_MODE_TYPE_HASH = keccak256("ModuleEnableMode(address module,bytes initData)");
```
