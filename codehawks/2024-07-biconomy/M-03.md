# Missing support for ERC-165

## Summary

The Nexus wallet fails to provide support for ERC-165, as required by the standard.

## Vulnerability Details

The Nexus smart account is intended to be compliant with the [ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579) standard. This specification, requires smart accounts [to implement ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579#erc-165):

> ERC-165
> Smart accounts MUST implement ERC-165. However, for every interface function that reverts instead of implementing the functionality, the smart account MUST return false for the corresponding interface id.

Additionally, as the smart account [supports also the ERC-1155 Token Receiver](https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-07-biconomy/blob/d2adadc0f3105eb789329eb3c958472638692a2d/contracts/base/ModuleManager.sol#L48-L49), the ERC-1155 requires contracts that implement the ERC1155TokenReceiver interface [to support ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#erc-1155-token-receiver):

> Smart contracts MUST implement the ERC-165 supportsInterface function and signify support for the ERC1155TokenReceiver interface to accept transfers. See “ERC1155TokenReceiver ERC-165 rules” for further detail.

## Impact

Failure to adhere to the standard and their specifications could lead to incompatibilities and different integration issues.

## Tools Used

None.

## Recommendations

Implement support for ERC-165 as required by ERC-7579 and ERC-1155.
