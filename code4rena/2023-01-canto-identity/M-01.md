# Fee recipient addresses can't be changed in the protocol

The CID protocol contains fees at two different levels, one is defined at the subprotocol level by the owner of the registered subprotocol and the other at the CID protocol level in the `CidNFT` and `SubprotocolRegistry` contracts.

In all cases, the address that collects the fees is immutable and can't be changed:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/main/src/CidNFT.sol#L24

```solidity
address public immutable cidFeeWallet;
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/main/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L23

```solidity
address public immutable cidFeeWallet;
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/main/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L29

```solidity
struct SubprotocolData {
    /// @notice Owner (registrant) of the subprotocol
    address owner;
    /// @notice Optional cost in NOTE to add an NFT
    /// @dev Maximum value is (2^96 - 1) / 10^18 =~ 80 billion. Zero for no fee
    uint96 fee;
    address nftAddress;
    bool ordered;
    bool primary;
    bool active;
}
```

## Impact

If any of these addresses becomes unavailable or gets compromised, fees will still be sent to those addresses and funds will be lost, as these can't be updated.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/main/src/CidNFT.sol#L190-L194

```solidity
if (subprotocolFee != 0) {
    uint256 cidFee = (subprotocolFee * CID_FEE_BPS) / 10_000;
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, cidFeeWallet, cidFee);
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, subprotocolOwner, subprotocolFee - cidFee);
}
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-canto-identity/blob/main/src/SubprotocolRegistry.sol#L87

```solidity
SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(note, msg.sender, cidFeeWallet, REGISTER_FEE);
```

## Recommendation 

Allow protocol owners to update the `cidFeeWallet` in the `CidNFT` and `SubprotocolRegistry` contract. Allow subprotocol owners to define and update a fee recipient address in their registered subprotocols.
