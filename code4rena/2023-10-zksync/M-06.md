# Upgradable contracts on L1 cannot be reinitializable

## Summary

The current design of the contract's initialization process does not support reinitializations, which may impact upgradeability.

## Impact

ZkSync Era contracts on L1 use the ReentrancyGuard mixin to provide both support to prevent reentrancy attacks, while also being used as initializers in proxy contracts.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/common/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L38-L59

```solidity
38:     uint256 private constant _NOT_ENTERED = 1;
39:     uint256 private constant _ENTERED = 2;
40: 
41:     modifier reentrancyGuardInitializer() {
42:         _initializeReentrancyGuard();
43:         _;
44:     }
45: 
46:     function _initializeReentrancyGuard() private {
47:         uint256 lockSlotOldValue;
48: 
49:         // Storing an initial non-zero value makes deployment a bit more
50:         // expensive but in exchange every call to nonReentrant
51:         // will be cheaper.
52:         assembly {
53:             lockSlotOldValue := sload(LOCK_FLAG_ADDRESS)
54:             sstore(LOCK_FLAG_ADDRESS, _NOT_ENTERED)
55:         }
56: 
57:         // Check that storage slot for reentrancy guard is empty to rule out possibility of slot conflict
58:         require(lockSlotOldValue == 0, "1B");
59:     }
```

The logic in ReentrancyGuard uses a neat trick to reuse the lock variable to also indicate if the contract is initialized. A zero value (the default) means the contract is not initialized, while the constants 1 and 2 are used to represent an unlocked and locked state.

The `reentrancyGuardInitializer` modifier works similarly to the [`initializer`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.9.3/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L84) modifier present in the OpenZeppelin contracts library. Line 58 checks that the previous slot value was zero, and sets the lock value to `_NOT_ENTERED = 1`. Further calls to this modifier will fail as the locking state toggles between `_NOT_ENTERED` and `_ENTERED`, and is never set back to zero.

The trick, however, has the detail that it doesn't support reinitializations, it just works a single time. Upgradeable contracts may need to be reintiialized, especially when providing new variables or dealing with migration tasks. This is considered in other libraries, such as the mentioned OpenZeppelin implementation, by treating the initialization variable as a counter and allowing versioned reinitializers that update this counter.

While this may be acceptable for the Diamond contract, as it supports a baked in upgradeble logic using [`diamondCut()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/zksync/libraries/Diamond.sol#L95), other contracts are potentially affected. Both bridge contracts on L1 use the ReentrancyGuard mixin and cannot support a reinitialization process when being upgraded.

## Proof of Concept

Both L1WethBridge and L1ERC20Bridge contracts are upgradeable contracts that use the ReentrancyGuard to provide support for proxy contract initialization. The contracts cannot be reinitialized if needed when upgraded.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1WethBridge.sol#L37

```solidity
37: contract L1WethBridge is IL1Bridge, AllowListed, ReentrancyGuard {
```

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/contracts/ethereum/contracts/bridge/L1ERC20Bridge.sol#L28

```solidity
28: contract L1ERC20Bridge is IL1Bridge, IL1BridgeLegacy, AllowListed, ReentrancyGuard {
```

## Recommendation

Provide a dedicated storage variable for initialization purposes, similar to how it works in the [Initializable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.9.3/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol) OpenZeppelin library. This will allow reinitializers in upgradeable contracts, ensuring a safer and future proof upgradeability support.
