# Incorrect max precompile address

## Summary

Two new precompiles have been introduced (`ECADD` and `ECMUL`) without updating the pointer that indicates the current maximum precompile address (`CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`), causing these new precompiles to not be considered as precompiles in the system.

## Impact

The updated revision of ZkSync Era has introduced two new precompiles, `ECADD` and `ECMUL` at addresses `0x06` and `0x07`, respectively.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/Constants.sol#L27-L28

```solidity
27: address constant ECADD_SYSTEM_CONTRACT = address(0x06);
28: address constant ECMUL_SYSTEM_CONTRACT = address(0x07);
```

Their implementation is available in `code/system-contracts/contracts/precompiles/EcAdd.yul` and `code/system-contracts/contracts/precompiles/EcMul.yul`.

Precompile addresses are tracked by a constant named `CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`, which points to the maximum address that is a precompile. The intention here is to have a way to determine if an address is a precompile, i.e. `precompile <=> address <= CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/Constants.sol#L35

```solidity
35: uint256 constant CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS = uint256(uint160(SHA256_SYSTEM_CONTRACT));
```

Note that the implementation still points to the old maximum precompile, which was `SHA256` at address `0x02`.

This means that both `ECADD` and `ECMUL` won't be considered as precompiles, this is because their address are greater than the `CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`, breaking the invariant.

Particularly, this impacts the `getCodeHash()` function in AccountCodeStorage. The function follows the assumption that a precompile is under the `CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS` constant in order to return the hash of the empty string (`EMPTY_STRING_KECCAK`).

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/AccountCodeStorage.sol#L89-L95

```solidity
89:     function getCodeHash(uint256 _input) external view override returns (bytes32) {
90:         // We consider the account bytecode hash of the last 20 bytes of the input, because
91:         // according to the spec "If EXTCODEHASH of A is X, then EXTCODEHASH of A + 2**160 is X".
92:         address account = address(uint160(_input));
93:         if (uint160(account) <= CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS) {
94:             return EMPTY_STRING_KECCAK;
95:         }
...
```

As both `ECADD` and `ECMUL` are greater than `CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS`, the implementation of `getCodeHash()` will return zero instead of the expected `EMPTY_STRING_KECCAK` constant, as other precompiles do.

## Proof of Concept

The following test asks the AccountCodeStorage contract for the code hash of the new precompiles. The expected value should be the keccak hash of the empty string.

```typescript
describe('AccountCodeStorage', function() {
    it('fails to return correct hash for ECADD precompile', async () => {
        expect(await accountCodeStorage.getCodeHash('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000006')).to.be.eq(
            EMPTY_STRING_KECCAK
        );
    });
    
    it('fails to return correct hash for ECMUL precompile', async () => {
        expect(await accountCodeStorage.getCodeHash('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000007')).to.be.eq(
            EMPTY_STRING_KECCAK
        );
    });
});
```

The expected results from these tests fail:

## Recommendation

Update the `CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS` pointer to include the new precompile addresses.

```diff
-    uint256 constant CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS = uint256(uint160(SHA256_SYSTEM_CONTRACT));
+    uint256 constant CURRENT_MAX_PRECOMPILE_ADDRESS = uint256(uint160(ECMUL_SYSTEM_CONTRACT));
```
