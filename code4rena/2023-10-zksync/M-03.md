# System contract upgrades will revert when provided value

## Summary

System contract upgrades are proposed on L1 to be performed on L2. 

Some upgrades [need to be provided ETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L254) `value` in order to perform deployment operations within their constructors.

`ForceDeployUpgrader` is [the contract that calls force deployment during the L2 system contract upgrade](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/contracts/zksync/contracts/ForceDeployUpgrader.sol#L8).

## Impact

Due to an error on this contract, it is not possible to execute an upgrade on L2 with `value > 0`.

System contract upgrades take time to be proposed + executed on L1 to send the upgrade transaction to L2.

If a system upgrade fails, it will take time and effort from the `Governance` owner and the security council to fix the issue and retry the execution.

This time window will also attract the attention of malicious actors, as system upgrades are rare events, and a failed transaction can expose an upgrade to a potential vulnerability.

Impact assessed as Medium according to "the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted".

## Proof of Concept

The expected upgrade flow on L2 is:

- [FORCE_DEPLOYER](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/system-contracts/contracts/Constants.sol#L48-L50) is the address that will trigger the upgrade.
- `FORCE_DEPLOYER` calls [ComplexUpgrader::upgrade()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/ComplexUpgrader.sol#L21-L22) by providing a contract that will be [delegatecalled](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/ComplexUpgrader.sol#L25).
- `ForceDeployUpgrader` is the delegated contract which will call [ContractDeployer::forceDeployOnAddresses()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/zksync/contracts/ForceDeployUpgrader.sol#L14)
- `ContractDeployer` is the contract reponsible for the upgrade via [forceDeployOnAddresses()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L238-L242).

Note that [ComplexUpgrader](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/ComplexUpgrader.sol#L21) has a `payable` to receive ETH and ultimately send it to the [ContractDeployer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L238). `ContractDeployer` checks that the `value` it receives [corresponds with the sum to be used by the upgraded contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/ContractDeployer.sol#L251).

The problem is that the delegated [ForceDeployUpgrader](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/contracts/zksync/contracts/ForceDeployUpgrader.sol#L13-L14) does not send that `value` to the `ContractDeployer`, making the transaction revert due to the inconsistency between the expected `value` and the one received (which is zero).

The missing code can be seen in the *Recommendation* section. The *Coded Proof of Concept* section shows how upgrade deployments that require ETH revert on the current codebase and proves that the recommended changes fixes this.

### Coded Proof of Concept

Copy this file to `code/system-contracts/contracts/ForceDeployUpgrader.sol`. It's a copy of [ForceDeployUpgrader.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/main/code/contracts/zksync/contracts/ForceDeployUpgrader.sol) for the purpose of running an integration test with the system contracts on the same Hardhat environment and shared artifacts. (note that the corresponding interface and the constants were copied to the file but the contract remains the same).

Copy this file to `code/system-contracts/test/ComplexUpgraderPOC.spec.ts` and run the test suite via the `quick-setup.sh`. 

The expected behavior after the fix can also be checked by commenting and uncommenting some lines pointed out on the test.

            params: [FORCE_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS]
        });
    });
});
```

## Recommendation

In order to fix it, it is important to make both of these changes:

- Add `payable` to `forceDeploy()`
- Add `{value: msg.value}` to the `forceDeployOnAddresses()` call

```diff
  contract ForceDeployUpgrader {
      /// @notice A function that performs force deploy
      /// @param _forceDeployments The force deployments to perform.
-      function forceDeploy(IContractDeployer.ForceDeployment[] calldata _forceDeployments) external {
-          IContractDeployer(DEPLOYER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT).forceDeployOnAddresses(_forceDeployments);
+      function forceDeploy(IContractDeployer.ForceDeployment[] calldata _forceDeployments) external payable {
+          IContractDeployer(DEPLOYER_SYSTEM_CONTRACT).forceDeployOnAddresses{value: msg.value}(_forceDeployments);
      }
  }
```
