# Incorrect `BOOTLOADER_TYPE` omits critical safety check to prevent address impersonation of system contracts

## Summary

The `Bootloader` contains conditional code snippets denoted with `<!-- @if {condition} -->` that are parsed on build time to allow different environments to work on, such as production, or a playground.

There's a conditional block that has a wrong value, and omits a critical check on a production environment deployment. That allows setting the `from` value of a transaction to a system contract address.

## Impact

An operator can attempt to impersonate a system contract address by bypassing the missing check and execute dangerous logic. Access control and permissions is an area of concern mentioned [in the Attack Ideas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/README.md#access-control-and-permissions) of the Readme.

Impersonating system contracts allow the execution of logic protected by modifiers like [onlyCallFromSystemContract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/contracts/interfaces/ISystemContract.sol#L25) and [onlySystemCall](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/docs/Smart%20contract%20Section/System%20contracts%20bootloader%20description.md#onlysystemcall-modifier)

> Some of the system contracts can act on behalf of the user or have a very important impact on the behavior of the account.

## Proof of Concept

The `Bootloader` used to have conditional blocks with the condition `BOOTLOADER_TYPE=='proved_block'` as can be seen from the codebase of the [last Code4rena contest](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2661-L2663).

There was a refactor in the codebase leading in the change `proved_block` -> `proved_batch` as [can be seen here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acode-423n4%2F2023-10-zksync+proved_batch&type=code). The only instance of the former value is the one pointed out in this report [as can be checked on the repository](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Acode-423n4%2F2023-10-zksync+proved_block&type=code).

The deployment version of the `Bootloader` is set by the [scripts/process.ts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-zksync/blob/1fb4649b612fac7b4ee613df6f6b7d921ddd6b0d/code/system-contracts/scripts/process.ts#L158-L161) and now has a value of `proved_batch`.

The `Bootloader` now has this outdated block with the mentioned critical check of the `from` attribute of the transaction that **won't be executed**, as `BOOTLOADER_TYPE` now can't have the value `proved_block` after the refactor:

```yul
  <!-- @if BOOTLOADER_TYPE=='proved_block' -->
  assertEq(gt(getFrom(innerTxDataOffset), MAX_SYSTEM_CONTRACT_ADDR()), 1, "from in kernel space")
  <!-- @endif -->
```

[bootloader.yul#L2661-L2663](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2661-L2663)

This block is the one in charge to [validate the structure of L2 transactions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2607-L2609), specifically in [this case](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/bootloader/bootloader.yul#L2657) they correspond to [EIP-1559 transactions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-zksync/blob/21d9a364a4a75adfa6f1e038232d8c0f39858a64/contracts/libraries/TransactionHelper.sol#L21-L22).

## Recommendation

Replace `proved_block` with the expected `proved_batch` in the `Bootloader`:

```diff
-   <!-- @if BOOTLOADER_TYPE=='proved_block' -->
+   <!-- @if BOOTLOADER_TYPE=='proved_batch' -->
    assertEq(gt(getFrom(innerTxDataOffset), MAX_SYSTEM_CONTRACT_ADDR()), 1, "from in kernel space")
    <!-- @endif -->
```
