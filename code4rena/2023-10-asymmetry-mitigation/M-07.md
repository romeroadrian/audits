# Mitigation of M-07: Mitigation Error, see comments

## Comments

The changes related to this issue are:

- Access control has been added to `AfEth::depositRewards()` using the `onlyVotiumOrRewarder` modifier. This function can now be called only by the rewarder or the VotiumStrategy.
- Access control has been added to `VotiumStrategy::depositRewards()` using the `onlyManager`. This function can now be called only by the manager role (AfEth).
- `AfEth::depositRewards()` now uses `msg.value` instead of receiving an `amount` parameter that might not match the sent `callvalue`.

This mitigates the issue, but there is still an edge related to an error introduced in the implementation of the `onlyManager` modifier.

```solidity
90:     modifier onlyManager() {
91:         if (address(manager) != address(0) && msg.sender != manager)
92:             revert NotManager();
93:         _;
94:     }
```

Access is still allowed if the `manager` address is uninitialized or has the default value of `address(0)`.

The issue is expanded in detail in [ADRIRO-NEW-M-01] (_Manager authorization in VotiumStrategy still leaves room for unprotected access_).
