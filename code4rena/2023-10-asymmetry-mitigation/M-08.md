# Mitigation of M-08: Issue mitigated

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry-findings/issues/35

## Comments

The proposed mitigation to fix the issue is to introduce access control for the `deposit()` function in the VotiumStrategy contract, to restrict access only to the manager (AfEth contract). Doing so, an attacker cannot front-run an honest deposit by directly depositing in the VotiumStrategy contract.

Furthermore, the VotiumStrategy contract now tracks CVX balances internally using the `trackedCvxBalance` variable. This also helps mitigate the issue, as an attacker cannot simply donate CVX to the contract to inflate the shares.
