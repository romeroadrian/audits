# Mitigation of M-06: Issue mitigated

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry-findings/issues/43

## Comments

The issue has been successfully mitigated by the introduction of a `deadline` parameter in both `deposit()` and `withdraw()` function of AfEth.

Deadlines in functions of VotiumStrategy can be ignored since these are now just accessed by the manager.
