# Mitigation of H-05: Issue mitigated

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry-findings/issues/23

## Comments

The issue is correctly mitigated, a summary of slippage control is provided.

AfEth:

- `deposit()`: has `_minout` parameter that controls how much AfEth tokens are minted. 
- `withdraw()`: has `_minout` parameter that controls how much ETH is returned.
- `depositRewards()`: slippage control parameters are forwarded to SafEth `stake()` and VotiumStrategy `depositRewards()`.

VotiumStrategy:

- `deposit()`: no slippage control, the function uses `buyCVX()` without slippage control, but now it is only callable by the manager (AfEth).
- `withdraw()`: no slippage control, the function uses `sellCVX()` without slippage control,, but now it is only callable by the manager (AfEth).
- `depositRewards()`: has `_cvxMinout` that is checked with the resulting value of `buyCVX()`.
- `applyRewards()`: has `_safEthMinout` and `_cvxMinout` that are forwarded when compounding rewards in SafEth or back to VotiumStrategy.

It should be noted that slippage control related to swaps of reward tokens for ETH is assumed to be correctly handled by the opaque call to 0x in `applyRewards()`.
