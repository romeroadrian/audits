# Mitigation of H-02: Issue mitigated

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry-findings/issues/36

## Comments

The unstaking from SafEth is not prevented if the amount is zero.

The withdrawal from Votium is still executed for a zero amount, however the issue has been mitigated in `sellCvx()` as recommended in the report.

It is recommended to skip the zero amount withdrawal from VotiumStrategy to avoid unneeded calls and save on gas costs.
