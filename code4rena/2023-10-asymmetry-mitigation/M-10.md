# Mitigation of M-10: Issue mitigated

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry-findings/issues/16

## Comments

The issue involved an edge case in which the compounded reward into SafEth wasn't enough to reach the minimum needed to stake into the contract.

The sponsor has decided to lower the minimum amount required to stake in SafEth to zero. This has been successfully checked by [querying `minAmount()`](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6732efaf6f39926346bef8b821a04b6361c4f3e5#readProxyContract#F15) at block 18416472.
