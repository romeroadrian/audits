## Comments

The updated algorithm now first checks if the current available CVX is enough, before looping through the locked balances in Convex.

```solidity
81:         uint256 totalLockedBalancePlusUnlockable = unlockable +
82:             trackedCvxBalance;
83: 
84:         if (totalLockedBalancePlusUnlockable >= cvxUnlockObligations) {
85:             withdrawIdToWithdrawRequestInfo[
86:                 latestWithdrawId
87:             ] = WithdrawRequestInfo({
88:                 cvxOwed: cvxAmount,
89:                 withdrawn: false,
90:                 epoch: currentEpoch + 1,
91:                 owner: msg.sender
92:             });
93:             emit WithdrawRequest(msg.sender, cvxAmount, latestWithdrawId);
94: 
95:             return latestWithdrawId;
96:         }
```

Note that the withdrawals are still delayed until the next epoch. This may not always imply a significant delay in the withdrawal, as the withdrawal can be executed near the end of the epoch, which will only delay things for the rest of the period. This issue is explored in detail in [ADRIRO-NEW-H-01] (_VotiumStrategy withdrawal can still be executed with minimal delay_).
