# Mitigation of H-04: Issue mitigated

## Comments

While withdrawing from AfEth, instead of transferring the tokens into the contract and subtracting those from the supply, the sponsor has decided to burn these directly.

```solidity
233:     function requestWithdraw(uint256 _amount) external virtual {
234:         if (pauseWithdraw) revert Paused();
235:         latestWithdrawId++;
236:         uint256 withdrawId = latestWithdrawId;
237: 
238:         uint256 withdrawRatio = (_amount * 1e18) / totalSupply();
239: 
240:         _burn(msg.sender, _amount);
```

This correctly mitigates the issue, as there is no need to account for any locked tokens when calculating the token supply.
