# Flash loan fee is incorrect in Private Pool contract

## Impact

Private Pools support NFT borrowing using flash loans. Users that decide to use this feature have to pay a flash loan fee to the owner of the pool.

The contract has a `changeFee` variable that is used to configure the fee for changing NFTs, and this variable is also used to determine the fee for flash loans. In the case of a change operation, the value is interpreted as an amount with 4 decimals, and the token is the base token of the pool. This means that, for example, if the base token is ETH, a `changeFee` value of 25 should be interpreted as a fee of 0.0025 ETH for change operation.

However, as we can see in this following snippet, the `flashFee` function just returns the value of `changeFee` without any scaling or modification.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L750-L752

```solidity
750:     function flashFee(address, uint256) public view returns (uint256) {
751:         return changeFee;
752:     }
```

This means that, following the previous example, a `changeFee` value of 25 will result in 0.0025 ETH for change operation, but **just 25 wei for flash loans**. The [documentation](https://docs.caviar.sh/technical-reference/custom-pools/smart-contract-api/privatepool#changefee) hints that this value should also be scaled to 4 decimals in the case of the flash loan fee, but in any case this is clearly an incorrect setting of the flash loan fee.

## Proof of Concept

In the following test, the pool is configured with a `changeFee` value of 25, and Alice is able to execute a flash loan by just paying 25 wei.

Note: the snippet shows only the relevant code for the test. Full test file can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/romeroadrian/06238839330315780b90d9202042ea0f).

```solidity
function test_PrivatePool_flashLoan_IncorrectFee() public {
    // Setup pool
    PrivatePool privatePool = new PrivatePool(
        address(factory),
        address(royaltyRegistry),
        address(stolenNftOracle)
    );
    uint56 changeFee = 25;
    privatePool.initialize(
        address(0), // address _baseToken,
        address(milady), // address _nft,
        100e18, // uint128 _virtualBaseTokenReserves,
        10e18, // uint128 _virtualNftReserves,
        changeFee, // uint56 _changeFee,
        0, // uint16 _feeRate,
        bytes32(0), // bytes32 _merkleRoot,
        false, // bool _useStolenNftOracle,
        false // bool _payRoyalties
    );
    
    uint256 tokenId = 0;
    milady.mint(address(privatePool), tokenId);
    
    // Alice executes a flash loan
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    
    FlashLoanBorrower flashLoanBorrower = new FlashLoanBorrower();
    
    // Alice just sends 25 wei!
    vm.deal(alice, changeFee);
    privatePool.flashLoan{value: changeFee}(flashLoanBorrower, address(milady), tokenId, "");
    
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

## Recommendation

The `flashFee` function should properly scale the value of the `changeFee` variable, similar to how it is implemented in `changeFeeQuote`.
