# Missing default validator for on-chain signatures

## Summary

For on-chain signatures, the validator routing design doesn't provide a default validator, requiring each individual hash to be defined using the `SetSignatureValidatorProposal`.

## Impact

In the implementation of the EIP-1271 standard for the Party contract, the signature validation is done on a per hash basis. The `SetSignatureValidatorProposal` defines a mapping that associates hashes to their corresponding validator:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/0ce3819de173f7688c9c834ce2cc758dd03c9bd2/contracts/proposals/SetSignatureValidatorProposal.sol#L8-L11

```solidity
08:     struct SetSignatureValidatorProposalStorage {
09:         /// @notice Mapping from signature hash to signature validator for validating ERC1271 signatures.
10:         mapping(bytes32 => IERC1271) signatureValidators;
11:     }
```

This mapping is later queried by the ProposalExecutionEngine contract in order to determine which validator should be used when validating a signature request:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-party/blob/0ce3819de173f7688c9c834ce2cc758dd03c9bd2/contracts/proposals/ProposalExecutionEngine.sol#L225-L245

```solidity
225:     function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature) external view returns (bytes4) {
226:         IERC1271 validator = getSignatureValidatorForHash(hash);
227:         if (address(validator) == address(1)) {
228:             // Signature set by party to be always valid
229:             return IERC1271.isValidSignature.selector;
230:         }
231:         if (address(validator) != address(0)) {
232:             return validator.isValidSignature(hash, signature);
233:         }
234:         if (tx.origin == address(0)) {
235:             validator = getSignatureValidatorForHash(0);
236:             if (address(validator) == address(0)) {
237:                 // Use global off-chain signature validator
238:                 validator = IERC1271(
239:                     _GLOBALS.getAddress(LibGlobals.GLOBAL_OFF_CHAIN_SIGNATURE_VALIDATOR)
240:                 );
241:             }
242:             return validator.isValidSignature(hash, signature);
243:         }
244:         return 0;
245:     }
```

As we can see in the previous snippet of code, for on-chain actions, validator routing is determined by the signature `hash`. Line 226 queries the mapping based on the given `hash`, and takes action based on the resulting address. As opposed to the off-chain case, all on-chain validation needs to be previously configured by executing a SetSignatureValidatorProposal for **each individual hash that wants to be validated**.

## Recommendation

Introduce the capability to configure a default validator for on-chain actions. This feature could be implemented as an opt-in functionality, activated and customized by submitting a proposal, similar to the SetSignatureValidatorProposal case. By incorporating this optional feature, parties gain flexibility, eliminating the need to whitelist individual hashes for signature validation.
