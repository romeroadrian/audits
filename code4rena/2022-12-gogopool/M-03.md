# Multisig addresses can't be unregistered in the `MultisigManager` contract

While multisig addresses in the `MultisigManager` contract can be disabled, there's no way to unregister an element in the contract.

Combined with the relatively low limit (`MULTISIG_LIMIT = 10`), this may lead to a scenario where there's no further room to add new addresses to the contract.

## Impact

New multisig addresses won't be able to be registered in the contract after the first 10 are registered.

## PoC

1. Call `MultisigManager.registerMultisig(address)` 10 times.
2. Any further call to `registerMultisig` will fail with the `MultisigLimitReached` error.

## Recommendation

Add a function to unregister an existing address or to directly replace with a new one.
