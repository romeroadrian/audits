# `operate` function in Spigot can be used to make arbitrary calls on behalf of the Spigot

The `operate` function in Spigot contract allows the borrower to operate the contracts associated with the Spigot, but there's no validation that enforces which are those contracts, allowing the operator to call any arbitrary contract on behalf of the Spigot.

## Impact

This can be used to call an unrelated contract (i.e. not any of the associated revenue contracts) on behalf of the Spigot with unintended effects.

This still depends on the function being whitelisted. As an example of a really bad case, if the `transfer(address,uint256)` is whitelisted (let's say the operator needs to transfer some kind of assets not related to the revenue stream), then this would allow him to call any `ERC20` token with the transfer function and steal funds from the Spigot.

## PoC

Any contract unrelated to the revenue contracts can be used to call (whitelisted) functions.

Note: the context for this test (setup, variables and helper functions) is similar to the one found in the file `Spigot.t.sol`.

```
contract UnrelatedContract {
    bool public called;
    
    function someNormalFunctionName() external {
        called = true;
    }
}

function test_Operate_ArbitraryCall() public {
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    
    spigot = new Spigot(owner, treasury, operator);
    
    // A common function name gets whitelisted in the spigot with the intentions of calling it in a revenue contract
    spigot.updateWhitelistedFunction(UnrelatedContract.someNormalFunctionName.selector, true);
    
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    vm.startPrank(operator);
    
    UnrelatedContract unrelatedContract = new UnrelatedContract();
    
    // However, since contracts aren't validated, it will allow to call any contract on behalf of the spigot
    spigot.operate(address(unrelatedContract), abi.encodeWithSelector(UnrelatedContract.someNormalFunctionName.selector));
    assertTrue(unrelatedContract.called());
}
```

## Recommendation

Validate the `revenueContract` param in the `operate` is really a revenue contract associated with the Spigot (for example using its `settings.transferOwnerFunction` which should be non-empty for valid revenue contracts).
