# Unprotected access to `depositAndRepay` function in LineOfCredit contract

The `depositAndRepay` function doesn't enforce any kind of access protection, but it should only be accessible to the borrower. See https://docs.debtdao.finance/faq/repaying-debt

## Impact

Anyone can call this function as it doesn't have any kind of validation around the caller. According to the documentation and specs, the function should only be callable by the borrower.

## Recommendation

Add the `onlyBorrower` modifier to correctly protect this function according to the specs.
