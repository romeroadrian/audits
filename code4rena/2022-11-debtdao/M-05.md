# FIFO repayment invariant isn't technically correct when a credit is re-borrowed

The FIFO invariant intended for the LineOfCredit contract isn't strictly followed when a credit gets borrowed again after being initially borrowed.

To correctly illustrate the issue, let's suppose there are two lenders. Each one opens a credit and deposits 1000 tokens (token is the same). Let's call them credit A and credit B.

Now, borrower first borrows 10 tokens from credit A. Credit A will be first in the queue, queue is:

```
[A, B]
```

Borrower now takes 1000 tokens from credit B. Queue will stay the same, since A still has debt and was first, B should come after A.

```
[A, B]
```

Lastly, the borrower borrows 990 tokens from credit A. When the queue gets resorted, it will still be the same since A is already in the queue. 

```
[A, B]
```

But since A is first in the queue, this will make credit A be repaid (in full) first, while technically credit A debt at first is just 10 tokens, then comes B with 1000 tokens, and lastly A again with 990 tokens.
