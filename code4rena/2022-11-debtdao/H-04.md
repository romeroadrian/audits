# Potential DoS in `claimRevenue` function with ETH token

When claiming ETH revenue in the Spigot, the contract will send the borrower's share to the treasury using the `address.transfer(amount)` function, which may fail and revert the whole function, leading to an eventual DoS.

## Impact

The `claimRevenue` function in the Spigot contract will calculate the ETH revenue that belongs to the treasury and send it using `LineLib.sendOutTokenOrETH`, which (in the case of ETH) will execute `address.transfer(amount)` to forward the ETH payment. 

If the treasury is a contract account, then this transfer function may fail and cause `claimRevenue` to revert entirely, leading to a DoS and the impossibility of calling this function successfully.

There are various reason to which this may fail and block the claiming procedure: a) the treasury can revert on purpose, b) have an unexpected error on its logic or c) run out of gas (which is particularly relevant since transfer has a limit of just 2300 units of gas)

See https://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html for a detailed description of a similar issue.

## PoC

In the following test, the Spigot is created with a treasury that consumes all available gas (for demo purposes, in reality this may be a function that inadvertently consumes a lot of gas) and will revert the claiming process.

Note: the context for this test (setup, variables and helper functions) is similar to the one found in the file `Spigot.t.sol`.

```
contract BrokenTreasury {
    fallback() external payable {
        // consume gas for demo purposes
        while(true) {}
    }
}

function test_ClaimRevenue_TreasuryDoS() public {
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    
    BrokenTreasury brokenTreasury = new BrokenTreasury();
    
    spigot = new Spigot(owner, address(brokenTreasury), operator);
    
    MockRevenueContract revenue = new MockRevenueContract(owner, RevenueToken(Denominations.ETH));
    
    ISpigot.Setting memory settings = ISpigot.Setting(90, claimPullPaymentFunc, transferOwnerFunc);
    require(spigot.addSpigot(address(revenue), settings), "Failed to add spigot");
    
    vm.deal(address(revenue), 1 ether);
    
    // Claim revenue from contract, this will claim the ETH and send a share to the treasury, which will always fail
    vm.expectRevert();
    spigot.claimRevenue(address(revenue), Denominations.ETH, abi.encodeWithSelector(claimPullPaymentFunc));
    
    assertEq(address(spigot).balance, 0);
    assertEq(address(brokenTreasury).balance, 0);        
}
```

### Recommendation

Use a "pull" pattern where the responsibility of transferring the ETH is shifted to the receiver instead of making it part of the whole process (see https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html). 

In this case, treasury ETH payments can be stored and accumulated in a contract variable of the Spigot, and sent when requested from the treasury.
