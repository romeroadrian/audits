# `LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH` can receive a greater ETH amount than expected

The `LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH` is used in different parts of the codebase to check for incoming ETH payments. This function allows the caller to send more than expected and doesn't refund ETH in excess.

## Impact

The `LineLib.receiveTokenOrETH` allows to receive any amount of ETH that is at least greater (or equal) to the expected amount, allowing payments made in excess by mistake and not refunding extra ETH to the caller. 

## PoC

Using `Escrow.addCollateral()` as an easy example, we can send `1 ether` by mistake for an amount of `0.1 ether`. The call will succeed, but just `0.1 ether` will be taken as the added amount of collateral.

```
escrow.addCollateral{value: 1 ether}(0.1 ether, Denominations.ETH);
```

## Recommendation

Change the if guard to be the exact amount `if(msg.value != amount) { revert TransferFailed(); }` or include a refund for the amount sent in excess.
