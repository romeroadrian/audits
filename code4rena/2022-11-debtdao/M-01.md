# Missing relation between Revenue contract and token in `claimRevenue` function of Spigot contract

The `claimRevenue` function can be called with any token, there's no restriction or validation if the given is associated with the given revenue stream.

## Impact

This is particularly concerning with pushed payments, as there is no way to know if a pushed payment came from the given contract, and can potentially be used to associated pushed payments from different revenue streams.

## PoC

In the following test there are two revenue streams associated with the spigot, one for token A and the other for token B. Revenue A pushes revenue using token A but then the claim is executed over revenue B.

Note: the context for this test (setup, variables and helper functions) is similar to the one found in the file `Spigot.t.sol`.

```
function test_ClaimRevenue_DifferentToken() public {
      vm.startPrank(owner);
      
      RevenueToken tokenA = new RevenueToken();
      RevenueToken tokenB = new RevenueToken();
      
      MockRevenueContract revenueA = new MockRevenueContract(owner, tokenA);
      MockRevenueContract revenueB = new MockRevenueContract(owner, tokenB);
      
      spigot = new Spigot(owner, treasury, operator);
      
      ISpigot.Setting memory settingsA = ISpigot.Setting(90, claimPushPaymentFunc, transferOwnerFunc);
      require(spigot.addSpigot(address(revenueA), settingsA), "Failed to add spigot");
      ISpigot.Setting memory settingsB = ISpigot.Setting(90, claimPushPaymentFunc, transferOwnerFunc);
      require(spigot.addSpigot(address(revenueB), settingsB), "Failed to add spigot");
      
      tokenA.mint(address(revenueA), 100);
      tokenB.mint(address(revenueB), 200);
      
      // RevenueA pushes payment
      revenueA.sendPushPayment(address(spigot));
      
      // Claim revenue on B but with token A
      uint256 result = spigot.claimRevenue(address(revenueB), address(tokenA), hex"");
      
      assertEq(result, 100);    
  }
```

## Recommendation

Link tokens with revenue streams, this way it's clear beforehand which tokens should be received from each revenue stream (needs further discussion in case multiple streams use the same token).
