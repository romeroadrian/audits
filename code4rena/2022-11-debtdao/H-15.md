# Closing an unexisting credit can overflow the credit count variable in the LineOfCredit contract

The LineOfCredit contract doesn't verify if a credit exists and is properly initialized when closing it, and will update its state anyway, leading to an inconsistent count.

## Impact

The `_close` function in the LineOfCredit contract doesn't check if the given credit is initialized (i.e. if it is a valid credit that was created through the line and it hasn't been already closed) and will still update the state of the line.

In particular, this is concerning because it will decrease the count variable, and since this update is wrapped in an unchecked math block, it can effectively overflow this variable. 

## PoC

The test is very simple, we need to call the `close` function with an id for an unexisting credit. This will decrease the value of the credit count variable from 0 to max uint, overflowing the value.

Note: the context for this test (setup, variables and helper functions) is similar to the one found in the file `LineOfCredit.t.sol`.

```
function test_close_OverflowCount() public {        
    vm.prank(borrower);
    line.close(keccak256("BOOM"));
    
    // BOOM! Count underflowed
    (uint256 count,) = line.counts();
    
    assertEq(count, type(uint256).max);
}
```

## Recommendation

Remove the unchecked math from the count variable update as a precautionary measure, since this variable plays an important role . Verify that a credit exists and isn't already closed when closing a credit.
