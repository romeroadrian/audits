# The `accrueInterest` function in LineOfCredit contract doesn't check for null/deleted credits 

The `accrueInterest` function will loop over all credit ids but fail to skip for positions that were previously closed/deleted as part of the closing procedure of a credit.

## Impact

The function will accrue interest on closed credit, since there isn't any check to skip these. Note that these are null positions that were previously fully repaid and closed.

## Recommendation

Add a guard to skip null/zeroed positions as `updateOutstandingDebt` does:

```
if(id == bytes32(0)) { continue; }
```
