# Uninitialized protocol fee address could cause loss of funds

## Summary

The address to which fees are sent is not initialized in the AfEth contract, and could cause loss of funds if fees are collected before this address is properly configured.

## Impact

AfEth protocol fees are collected from rewards coming from the Votium strategy. After tokens are claimed, the `depositRewards()` will take a portion of it and send them to the configured `feeAddress`.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-asymmetry/blob/main/contracts/AfEth.sol#L272-L279

```solidity
272:     function depositRewards(uint256 _amount) public payable {
273:         IVotiumStrategy votiumStrategy = IVotiumStrategy(vEthAddress);
274:         uint256 feeAmount = (_amount * protocolFee) / 1e18;
275:         if (feeAmount > 0) {
276:             // solhint-disable-next-line
277:             (bool sent, ) = feeAddress.call{value: feeAmount}("");
278:             if (!sent) revert FailedToSend();
279:         }
```

The main issue here is that this address is not part of the contract initialization. If left uninitialized, the implementation will send the collected ETH from fees to the `address(0)`.

## Recommendation

Configure the `feeAddress` in the contract's initializer to make sure this address is correctly configured when the instance is set up.

```diff
- function initialize() external initializer {
+ function initialize(address _feeAddress) external initializer {
      _transferOwnership(msg.sender);
      ratio = 5e17;
+     feeAddress = _feeAddress;
  }
```
