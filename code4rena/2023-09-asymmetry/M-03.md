# Missing storage gap in AbstractStrategy may affect contract upgradeability

## Summary

The AbstractStrategy contract is intended to be used as a base contract for upgradeable strategies but doesn't contain any storage gap to ensure enough space for future revisions.

## Impact

In the AfEth protocol, strategies extend a base contract named AbstractStrategy. Currently, there's only one implemented strategy (VotiumStrategy) that inherits from this base contract.

While the AbstractStrategy contract currently doesn't provide any concrete functionality, is it possible to extend its implementation in a future version, as this is an _abstract_ contract that can allow partial implementations.

Being part of an inheritance chain of upgradeable contracts, it is crucial to maintain the storage layout. Any base contract that might eventually require storage space must reserve it in advance.

The current implementation of AbstractStrategy overlooks this consideration. Any future revision of this contract that may require defining and using storage variables will have its storage space clashing with the contract next in the chain.

## Recommendation

To resolve this issue, add a dummy storage gap array to reserve storage space for future additions to the contract.

```diff
  abstract contract AbstractStrategy is
      Initializable,
      ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
      ERC20Upgradeable
  {
+     uint256[50] private __gap;
```
