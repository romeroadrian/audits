# Snapshot delegation cannot be cleared or modified

## Summary

Convex voting power is delegated to the Votium protocol when the VotiumStrategy contract is deployed and cannot be cleared or changed if required.

## Impact

The Votium strategy contract earns Convex rewards by delegating its voting power to Votium. This is done using the Snapshot 
protocol, when the VotingStrategy contract is deployed, it calls the Snapshot registry to register the delegation.

```solidity
100:     function initialize(
101:         address _owner,
102:         address _rewarder,
103:         address _manager
104:     ) external initializer {
105:         bytes32 VotiumVoteDelegationId = 0x6376782e65746800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000;
106:         address DelegationRegistry = 0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446;
107:         address votiumVoteProxyAddress = 0xde1E6A7ED0ad3F61D531a8a78E83CcDdbd6E0c49;
108:         ISnapshotDelegationRegistry(DelegationRegistry).setDelegate(
109:             VotiumVoteDelegationId,
110:             votiumVoteProxyAddress
111:         );
```

After this registration is done, there is no current way of clearing or modifying this action. If the Snapshot id changes, or the Votium address changes, the protocol administrators won't be able to modify the delegation.

## Recommendation

Add a function controlled by the owner of the protocol to modify the registration:

```solidity
function setDelegation(bytes32 id, address target) external onlyOwner {
    address DelegationRegistry = 0x469788fE6E9E9681C6ebF3bF78e7Fd26Fc015446;
    ISnapshotDelegationRegistry(DelegationRegistry).setDelegate(id, target);
}
```
