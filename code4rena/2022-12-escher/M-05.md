# `LPDA` sale should be able to be finalized when the end time is reached

The `LPDA` sale type is created with a configurable end time which is not taked into account and doesn't play any role in finalizing the auction.

The ending condition for the sale in this contract can be seen in lines 81-87:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-escher/blob/main/src/minters/LPDA.sol#L81-L87

```solidity
if (newId == temp.finalId) {
    sale.finalPrice = uint80(price);
    uint256 totalSale = price * amountSold;
    uint256 fee = totalSale / 20;
    ISaleFactory(factory).feeReceiver().transfer(fee);
    temp.saleReceiver.transfer(totalSale - fee);
    _end();
}
```

This means that the only way to end an auction and distribute funds is when the last NFT in the sale is sold. The sale's `endTime` should be taked into account and the owner should be able to finalize the auction provided the sale has reached this end time.

## Impact

Since the auction end time is not taked into account to finalize and end the sale, the owner or sale beneficiary will need to rely 
on all NFTs from the sale being sold in order to end the sale and withdraw funds.

This will make it impossible to withdraw funds until the last NFT from the sale is sold, even if the auction has already ended.

## PoC

1. Create a sale using `LPDAFactory.createLPDASale` with `startTime = t1` and `endTime = t2`.
2. During `t1` to `t2` not all NFTs from the collection are sold. Meaning that at time `t2`, `sale.currentId < sale.finalId`.
3. When `t2` is reached the auction has reached it's end time, but the owner of the sale can't finalize it and withdraw their funds.

## Recommendation

Add a `finalize` function (similar to the `OpenEdition` sale) to able to end the auction and withdraw funds to beneficiaries. In this case, the `finalPrice` should be set to the price that corresponds to the `sale.endTime` time.

```solidity
contract LPDA is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, ISale {
    ....

    bool finalized;

    function finalize() external {
        Sale memory _sale = sale;
        require(block.timestamp >= _sale.endTime, "TOO SOON");
        require(!finalized, "ALREADY FINALIZED");
        
        uint256 price = getPrice(); // this should properly return price because timeElapse == end - start
        
        // Update storage state
        sale.finalPrice = price;
        sale.finalId = _sale.currentId;
        finalized = true;
        
        // Distribute funds
        uint256 totalSale = price * amountSold;
        uint256 fee = totalSale / 20;
        ISaleFactory(factory).feeReceiver().transfer(fee);
        _sale.saleReceiver.transfer(totalSale - fee);
        
        // emit event
        _end();
    }
}
```
