# Owner can silently withdraw funds just before deadline in `StakedTokenLock`

The `StakedTokenLock` contract is responsible for the time lock of the team's initial set of funds. The implementation has a "deposit deadline" and allows to withdraw already deposited funds out of the timelock before this deadline.

## Impact

A malicious owner can trick users by first depositing all of their tokens in the timelock and then withdrawing all of them just before the deadline is reached.

The owner can freely call withdraw before the deadline is reached, and since this function doesn't emit any event it is likely that nobody is monitoring it while the protocol owners can silently remove all the liquidity from the timelock. 

## Proof of Concept

The following test describes the scenario:

```solidity
contract AuditTest is LotteryTestBase {
    function test_StakedTokenLock_withdraw_RemoveLiquidityJustBeforeDeadline() public {
        address owner = makeAddr("owner");

        vm.startPrank(owner);

        TestToken stakedToken = new TestToken();
        TestToken rewardsToken = new TestToken();
        vm.mockCall(
            address(stakedToken), abi.encodeWithSelector(IStaking.rewardsToken.selector), abi.encode(rewardsToken)
        );

        uint256 depositDeadline = block.timestamp + 7 days;
        uint256 lockDuration = 365 days;
        uint256 lockAmount = 1_000_000 ether;

        StakedTokenLock stakedTokenLock = new StakedTokenLock(
            address(stakedToken),
            depositDeadline,
            lockDuration
        );

        stakedToken.mint(lockAmount);
        stakedToken.approve(address(stakedTokenLock), lockAmount);

        // owner deposits funds
        stakedTokenLock.deposit(lockAmount);

        // Just before the deadline ends, owner silently withdraws everything
        vm.warp(depositDeadline);
        stakedTokenLock.withdraw(lockAmount);

        // Timelock contract is empty
        vm.warp(depositDeadline + 1);
        assertEq(stakedToken.balanceOf(address(stakedTokenLock)), 0);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

## Recommendation

Prevent withdrawals of tokens once these are deposited, not even before the deadline. If not, emit an event in the `withdraw` function to signal the withdrawal to allow it to be monitored off-chain.
