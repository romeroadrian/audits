# Overflow risk in `calculateExcessPot` function

The function `calculateExcessPot` present in the `LotteryMath` library implements the formula to calculate the pot excess value that is involved in the bonus calculation of rewards:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin/blob/main/src/LotteryMath.sol#L62-L66

```solidity
function calculateExcessPot(int256 netProfit, uint256 fixedJackpotSize) internal pure returns (uint256 excessPot) {
    int256 excessPotInt = netProfit.getPercentageInt(SAFETY_MARGIN);
    excessPotInt -= int256(fixedJackpotSize);
    excessPot = excessPotInt > 0 ? uint256(excessPotInt) : 0;
}
```

The first thing that can be noted is that `netProfit` is of type `int256`, meaning that it can be negative. If it's negative, then there's no point in doing the calculation as there won't be any excess since there's no profit at all.

However, the main issue here is the casting of `fixedJackpotSize` to `int256`. If the `fixedJackpotSize` is large enough, it will overflow the capacity of `int256` and become negative.

## Impact

Given the described scenario, the call to `calculateExcessPot` will yield wrong results, which will cascade into the functions `calculateNewProfit` and `calculateReward`. 

## Proof of Concept

Example: if `fixedJackpotSize == 2 ** 256 - 1` then casting it as `int256` will result in `-1`.

```bash
❯ chisel
Welcome to Chisel! Type `!help` to show available commands.
➜ uint256 fixedJackpotSize = type(uint256).max;
➜ int256(fixedJackpotSize)
Type: int
├ Hex: 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
└ Decimal: -1
```

## Recommendation

The implementation of `calculateExcessPot` can be done entirely using unsigned arithmetic since negative values of `netProfit` can be early discarded.

```solidity
function calculateExcessPot(int256 netProfit, uint256 fixedJackpotSize) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (netProfit <= 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    
    uint256 excessPot = uint256(netProfit).getPercentage(SAFETY_MARGIN);
    
    if (excessPot <= fixedJackpotSize) {
      return 0;
    }
    
    return excessPot - fixedJackpotSize;
}
```

Note: this is the only use of `getPercentageInt`, meaning this function can be completely removed from the codebase with the proposed change.
