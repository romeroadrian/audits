# Ticket minting should use `safeMint`

Lottery tickets are represented by NFTs using the `ERC721` standard. When tickets are bought, the protocol will mint the corresponding NFT to the caller using the `_mint` internal call to the OpenZeppelin implementation. This function doesn't implement the check to ensure the caller is able to handle ERC721 NFTs in case it is a contract.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin/blob/main/src/Ticket.sol#L23-L27

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint128 drawId, uint120 combination) internal returns (uint256 ticketId) {
    ticketId = nextTicketId++;
    ticketsInfo[ticketId] = TicketInfo(drawId, combination, false);
    _mint(to, ticketId);
}
```

## Impact

Contracts that interact with the protocol and purchase tickets will likely result in the loss of tickets if the caller contract is unaware of the NFT transfer and fails to implement proper support to handle them.

## Recommendation

Use `_safeMint` when minting tickets:

```solidity
function mint(address to, uint128 drawId, uint120 combination) internal returns (uint256 ticketId) {
    ticketId = nextTicketId++;
    ticketsInfo[ticketId] = TicketInfo(drawId, combination, false);
    _safeMint(to, ticketId);
}
```
