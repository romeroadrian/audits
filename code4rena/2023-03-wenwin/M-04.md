# Protocol fails to support arbitrary token for rewards

Fixed rewards for the different winning tiers are packed in a 256 bit word during Lottery setup. During packing, the code will discard most of the precision of the given values and just keep 1 decimal:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-wenwin/blob/main/src/LotterySetup.sol#L164-L176

```solidity
function packFixedRewards(uint256[] memory rewards) private view returns (uint256 packed) {
    if (rewards.length != (selectionSize) || rewards[0] != 0) {
        revert InvalidFixedRewardSetup();
    }
    uint256 divisor = 10 ** (IERC20Metadata(address(rewardToken)).decimals() - 1);
    for (uint8 winTier = 1; winTier < selectionSize; ++winTier) {
        uint16 reward = uint16(rewards[winTier] / divisor);
        if ((rewards[winTier] % divisor) != 0) {
            revert InvalidFixedRewardSetup();
        }
        packed |= uint256(reward) << (winTier * 16);
    }
}
```

Since the protocol supports arbitrary ERC20 tokens as rewards, this means that most tokens won't be supported in the practice as there's enough precision to express logical values for rewards.

## Impact

Protocol can't be used in the practice with most common tokens (ETH or BTC for example) as the fixed rewards support at most one decimal of precision.

Given the time of writing, this means that for BTC the minimum reward that can be supported is 0.1 BTC which is ~2175 USD, or in the case of ETH a minimum of 0.1 ETH represents ~155 USD.

This issue can be worse for other tokens with a low supply that rely heavily on decimals.

## Recommendation

My recommendation here would be to get rid of the packing and just store the array of values with full precision. This will incur higher gas costs, but will solve precision issues while also reducing complexity.
