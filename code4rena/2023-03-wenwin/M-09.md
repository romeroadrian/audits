# `swapSource` in `RNSourceController` contract can be frontrunned and eventually lead to a DoS

## Impact

A malicious randon source con frontrun calls to `swapSource` and prevent protocol owners from changing the random source by frontrunning the call with a transaction to `onRandomNumberFulfilled` which effectively resets the `failedSequentialAttempts` to zero, making the original call to `swapSource` revert.

This process can be repeated any number of times, eventually leading to a DoS and the impossibility of changing the random source.

## Proof of Concept

1. Source timeouts and doesn't return request response, retry is called until `failedSequentialAttempts == maxFailedAttempts`.
2. Protocol owners call `swapSource` to change the random source of the contract
3. Current random source frontruns the call with a call to `onRandomNumberFulfilled` which resets the `failedSequentialAttempts` back to 0.
4. Original transaction from (2) gets reverted as `failedSequentialAttempts` is now less than `maxFailedAttempts`.

## Recommendation

In case of `maxFailedAttempts` enter a more robust "pause" state that lets protocol owners deal better with the current situation.
