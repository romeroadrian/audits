# Funds transfers are not validated against non standard ERC20 transfers

## Impact

An attacker could maliciously benefit from matching an order whose payment token follows a non standard ERC20 `transfer` implementation. 

Buyer's funds are transferred to the seller in the function `transferERC20` present in the contract `ExecutionDelegate`, which calls the `transferFrom` function of ERC20, which will only fail if the function reverts (the return value of `transferFrom` is returned to the caller but `BlurExchange` doesn't check this value in line 515). This should be ok according to the standard, but there are ERC20 implementations that don't follow the standard and, for example, use the bool return value to indicate success.

Currently the `BlurExchange` contract only allows `WETH` as an option for the payment token, which should be safe assuming the contract at `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2`. But given the presence of an arbitrary payment token address in the order and the design of the `ExecutionDelegate` contract this may change in the future and be expanded to allow other ERC20 tokens as payments.

This would allow an attacker to buy tokens for free in certain cases, if the payment token chosen by the seller follows the pattern described above, an attacker could simply match the order without having the required payment tokens. The funds transfer will silently fail and the NFT will be transferred to the attacker.

## Recommendation

Use an ERC20 wrapper that guards against these non standard scenarios, for example OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#SafeERC20
