# Cached EIP-712 domain separator may lead to replay attacks

The usage of a cached `DOMAIN_SEPRATOR` present in the initializer of the `BlurExchange` contract may lead to replay attacks in the case of an eventual fork of the chain, since the cached domain separator is constructed with an initial `chainId` that isn't checked afterwards.

## Recommendation

Compare the cached `chainId` to `block.chainId` to use the cached `DOMAIN_SEPRATOR`, see `EIP712` in OZ contracts: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/EIP712.sol#L70
