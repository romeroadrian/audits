# Incorrect rounding in `buyQuote` 

The function `buyQuote` present in the `Pair` contract is used to calculate the amount of base tokens required to buy a given amount of fractional tokens.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-caviar/blob/main/src/Pair.sol#L398-L400

```solidity
function buyQuote(uint256 outputAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
    return (outputAmount * 1000 * baseTokenReserves()) / ((fractionalTokenReserves() - outputAmount) * 997);
}
```

The integer division will round down the return value, while the correct behavior should be to round up in favor of the protocol.

## Impact

The `buyQuote` function will round down the division, which means that the required amount of base tokens that the user needs to input to take a given amount of fractional tokens will be rounded down. 

The result amount will then be rounded down in favor of the user calling the `buy` instead of favoring the LPs.

## Proof of Concept

If the numerator `outputAmount * 1000 * baseTokenReserves()` isn't a multiple of the denominator `(fractionalTokenReserves() - outputAmount) * 997`, then the integer division will round the result down.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Following UniswapV2 `getAmountIn` implementation, a `+1` can be added to the calculation to force the rounding to be up:

```solidity
function buyQuote(uint256 outputAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
    return ((outputAmount * 1000 * baseTokenReserves()) / ((fractionalTokenReserves() - outputAmount) * 997)) + 1;
}
```

As a more technically correct alternative, it is also possible to use solmate's `FixedPointMathLib.mulDivUp` to calculate the `buyQuote` formula (this library is already used and imported in the project).
