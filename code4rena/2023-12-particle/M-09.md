# Non-upgradeable contract may cause storage clashing during upgrades

## Summary

The ParticlePositionManager contract inherits from a contract that is incompatible with upgrades, which can cause a storage conflict when upgraded.

## Impact

The ParticlePositionManager contract is an UUPS upgradeable contract that inherits from other base contracts. One of these base dependencies is the ReentrancyGuard contract.

```solidity
19: contract ParticlePositionManager is
20:     IParticlePositionManager,
21:     Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
22:     UUPSUpgradeable,
23:     IERC721Receiver,
24:     ReentrancyGuard,
25:     Multicall
26: {
```

As we can see in the implementation, the ReentrancyGuard import is using the non-upgradeable version of the OpenZeppelin library instead of the proper upgradeable variant ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable. 

Mixing non-upgradeable contracts in a chain of upgradeable contracts can cause multiple issues. 

First, there is the discrepancy of the contract initialization. Non-upgradeable contracts are initialized via normal constructors, which doesn't have effect in upgradeable contracts managed through a proxy. In the case of ReentrancyGuard, this is mitigated by the fact that storage initialization isn't really needed. The contract will work fine even if its storage is not initialized.

Another issue is storage clashing. Upgradeable contracts allocate a reserved space of storage, usually called `__gap`, to allow for future modifications. Since these contracts are part of an inheritance chain, they need to save some space upfront, else adding new storage variables would clash with the storage space of the contract next in chain. In the case of ParticlePositionManager, using the non-upgradeable version of ReentrancyGuard means that there is no reserved space, and that any new storage introduced in ReentrancyGuard will clash with the storage space of the next contract in line, which is the ParticlePositionManager contract itself.

## Proof of concept

Using forge we can see the storage layout of the ParticlePositionManager contract.

```

The `_status` variable of the ReentrancyGuard contract (slot 251) is right before `_nextRecordId` (slot 252), the first slot of storage variables of ParticlePositionManager, without any gap in between. If any new storage slot is introduced in the ReentrancyGuard contract, it will clash with the variables of ParticlePositionManager, shifting everything that comes after.

## Recommendation

Change ReentrancyGuard for its upgradeable variant ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.
