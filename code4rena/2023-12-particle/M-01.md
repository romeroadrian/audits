# Modifying the loan term setting can default existing loans

## Summary

Protocol admins can modify the loan term settings. This action can inadvertently default existing loans created under different terms.

## Impact

Positions in the Particle LAMM protocol are created for a configurable period of time, defined by the `LOAN_TERM` variable. If the loan exceeds this duration, and the LP owner stops renewals that affect their position, the lien can be liquidated.

```solidity
358:         // check for liquidation condition
359:         ///@dev the liquidation condition is that
360:         ///     (EITHER premium is not enough) OR (cutOffTime > startTime AND currentTime > startTime + LOAN_TERM)
361:         if (
362:             !((closeCache.tokenFromPremium < liquidateCache.tokenFromOwed ||
363:                 closeCache.tokenToPremium < liquidateCache.tokenToOwed) ||
364:                 (lien.startTime < lps.getRenewalCutoffTime(lien.tokenId) &&
365:                     lien.startTime + LOAN_TERM < block.timestamp))
366:         ) {
367:             revert Errors.LiquidationNotMet();
368:         }
```

The liquidation condition in line 365 does the check using the current value of `LOAN_TERM`. As the loan term can be updated using `updateLoanTerm()`, this means that reducing this value may inadvertently cause the liquidation of existing positions that were originally intended for a longer period of time.

## Proof of concept

Let's say the current configured loan term in ParticlePositionManager is 2 weeks.

1. A user creates a new position, expecting it to last at least 2 weeks.
2. The owner of the LP calls `reclaimLiquidity()` to stop it from being renewed.
3. The protocol changes the loan term setting to 1 week.
4. The user is liquidated after 1 week.

## Recommendation

Store the loan term value at the time the position was created in the Lien structure, e.g. in `lien.loanTerm`. When checking the liquidation condition, calculate the end time using this value to honor the original loan term.

```diff
    if (
        !((closeCache.tokenFromPremium < liquidateCache.tokenFromOwed ||
            closeCache.tokenToPremium < liquidateCache.tokenToOwed) ||
            (lien.startTime < lps.getRenewalCutoffTime(lien.tokenId) &&
-               lien.startTime + LOAN_TERM < block.timestamp))
+               lien.startTime + lien.loanTerm < block.timestamp))
    ) {
        revert Errors.LiquidationNotMet();
    }
```
