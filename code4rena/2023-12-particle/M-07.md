# ERC20 implementations may revert on zero approval

## Summary

Some ERC20 implementations revert when `approve()` is called with a zero amount, causing a denial of service when token allowances are reset.

## Impact

Token allowances in the LAMM implementation follow a pattern in which approvals are setup for the required amount before executing the operation, and then reset back to zero after executing the operation.

The same behavior is present in `Base.swap()`, `LiquidityPosition.mint()` and `LiquidityPosition.increaseLiquidity()`. Taking the latter as an example, we can see the implementation calls `safeApprove()` with the required amount, then executes the call to `increaseLiquidity()` in the Uniswap NPM contract, and finally it resets the allowances back to zero by executing another call to  `safeApprove()`, to ensure any unused allowance is cleared.

```solidity
178:     function increaseLiquidity(
179:         address token0,
180:         address token1,
181:         uint256 tokenId,
182:         uint256 amount0,
183:         uint256 amount1
184:     ) internal returns (uint128 liquidity, uint256 amount0Added, uint256 amount1Added) {
185:         // approve spending for uniswap's position manager
186:         TransferHelper.safeApprove(token0, Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER_ADDR, amount0);
187:         TransferHelper.safeApprove(token1, Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER_ADDR, amount1);
188: 
189:         // increase liquidity via position manager
190:         (liquidity, amount0Added, amount1Added) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER.increaseLiquidity(
191:             INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
192:                 tokenId: tokenId,
193:                 amount0Desired: amount0,
194:                 amount1Desired: amount1,
195:                 amount0Min: 0,
196:                 amount1Min: 0,
197:                 deadline: block.timestamp
198:             })
199:         );
200: 
201:         // reset approval
202:         TransferHelper.safeApprove(token0, Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER_ADDR, 0);
203:         TransferHelper.safeApprove(token1, Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER_ADDR, 0);
204:     }
```

Some ERC20 implementations [revert on approvals of zero value](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#revert-on-zero-value-approvals). One major example is the BNB token, that [throws when called with `0` as the amount argument](https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52#code#L94). 

This will cause a denial of service in any of the mentioned functions, preventing the protocol from being used under the presence of such tokens.

## Recommendation

There is no clean solution for this issue, a potential workaround could be to set the allowance to 1 wei:

1. First, check the current allowance. If it is zero already, skip any modification (this will also save gas).
2. Execute a non-reverting call to `approve()` using zero. 
3. If the previous call fails, then execute an approval for 1 wei.
