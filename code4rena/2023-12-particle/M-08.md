# Dangerous use of deadline parameter

## Summary

The protocol is using `block.timestamp` as the deadline argument while interacting with the Uniswap NFT Position Manager, which completely defeats the purpose of using a deadline.

## Impact

Actions in the Uniswap NonfungiblePositionManager contract are protected by a `deadline` parameter to limit the execution of pending transactions. Functions that modify the liquidity of the pool check this parameter against the current block timestamp in order to discard expired actions.

These interactions with the Uniswap position are present in the LiquidityPosition library. The functions `mint()`, `increaseLiquidity()` and `decreaseLiquidity()` call their corresponding functions in the Uniswap Position Manager, providing `block.timestamp` as the argument for the `deadline` parameter:

```solidity
131:         // mint the position
132:         (tokenId, liquidity, amount0Minted, amount1Minted) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER.mint(
133:             INonfungiblePositionManager.MintParams({
134:                 token0: params.token0,
135:                 token1: params.token1,
136:                 fee: params.fee,
137:                 tickLower: params.tickLower,
138:                 tickUpper: params.tickUpper,
139:                 amount0Desired: params.amount0ToMint,
140:                 amount1Desired: params.amount1ToMint,
141:                 amount0Min: params.amount0Min,
142:                 amount1Min: params.amount1Min,
143:                 recipient: address(this),
144:                 deadline: block.timestamp
145:             })
146:         );

```solidity
189:         // increase liquidity via position manager
190:         (liquidity, amount0Added, amount1Added) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER.increaseLiquidity(
191:             INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams({
192:                 tokenId: tokenId,
193:                 amount0Desired: amount0,
194:                 amount1Desired: amount1,
195:                 amount0Min: 0,
196:                 amount1Min: 0,
197:                 deadline: block.timestamp
198:             })
199:         );
```

```solidity
254:         (amount0, amount1) = Base.UNI_POSITION_MANAGER.decreaseLiquidity(
255:             INonfungiblePositionManager.DecreaseLiquidityParams({
256:                 tokenId: tokenId,
257:                 liquidity: liquidity,
258:                 amount0Min: 0,
259:                 amount1Min: 0,
260:                 deadline: block.timestamp
261:             })
262:         );
```

Using `block.timestamp` as the deadline is effectively a no-operation that has no effect nor protection. Since `block.timestamp` will take the timestamp value when the transaction gets mined, the check will end up comparing `block.timestamp` against the same value, i.e. `block.timestamp <= block.timestamp` (see https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/697c2474757ea89fec12a4e6db16a574fe259610/contracts/base/PeripheryValidation.sol#L7).

Failure to provide a proper deadline value enables pending transactions to be maliciously executed at a later point. Transactions that provide an insufficient amount of gas such that they are not mined within a reasonable amount of time, can be picked by malicious actors or MEV bots and executed later in detriment of the submitter. 

See [this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-backed-findings/issues/64) for an excellent reference on the topic (the author runs a MEV bot).

## Recommendation

Add a deadline parameter to each of the functions that are used to manage the liquidity position, `ParticlePositionManager.mint()`, `ParticlePositionManager.increaseLiquidity()` and `ParticlePositionManager.decreaseLiquidity()`. Forward this parameter to the corresponding underlying calls to the Uniswap NonfungiblePositionManager contract.
