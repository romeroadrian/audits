# Incorrect mask size when decoding `oracleId` parameter

The function `_getOracleParameters` present in the `LBPair` decodes the oracle parameters from storage by manually sloading the slot and applying bit math to extract the individual values.

The decoding of the `oracleId` is correctly offset by 224, but it applies a mask of 24 bits, while the size of this variable is 16 bits (see the definition in the `PairInformation` struct).

This may lead to incorrectly reading the variable and decoding it with a wrong value, since the function is reading outside the variable bounds.
