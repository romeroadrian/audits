# `addToTree` and `removeFromTree` should take the `_id` argument as a `uint24`

The tree operates on bin ids which should be 24 bit long. This is mainly because there are 3 levels of depth and each level is defined by an array of 256 positions (represented as a uint256). We need 8 bits to index each level (`2**8=256`), which means we need 24 bits for the 3 levels.

The depth for the second level (referred as `_idDepth1` in the code) is implemented by shifting 16 positions to the right:

```
binId = (level1, level2, level3)
binId >> 16 => (0, 0, level1)
```

The depth for the third level (referred as `_idDepth2` in the code) is implemented similarly by shifting 8 positions to the right:

```
binId = (level1, level2, level3)
binId >> 8 => (0, level1, level2)
```

The function `addToTree` and `removeFromTree` receive the bin id argument as a `uint256`. If any bit above the 24th bit is non-zero then the semantics of the tree break, since the depth calculation described above will contain a non-zero value in the upper bits. 

These functions should either define the arguments as `uint24` or sanitize the inputs and apply a mask to clear any non-zero value above the 24th bit.
