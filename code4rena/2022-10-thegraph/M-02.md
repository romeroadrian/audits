# Remove burn capabilities from `L2GraphToken`

## Impact

The contract `L2GraphToken` inherits from `ERC20BurnableUpgradeable` which adds public burning functions and lets accounts burn tokens at will using `burn(uint256 amount)` and `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)`.

This would let any token holder in L2 (or anyone that the holder has approved) to burn GRT tokens present in Arbitrum and could lead to an unnecessary scenario where the bridge escrow in L1 contains tokens that have been burned in L2.

I can't find any indication of this feature being intentional. It could be the case here that `ERC20BurnableUpgradeable` was added to the inheritance chain to add the burn capabilities so that the L2 Gateway could burn tokens during the bridge process. But this isn't necessary since OpenZeppelin's ERC20 base implementation already contains this feature, see the recommendation below.

If intentional, then there should be a way to bridge the burning back to L1 to keep the token supply in sync. 

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `ERC20BurnableUpgradeable` for `ERC20Upgradeable` in `GraphTokenUpgradeable`, this would remove the public burn functions. Then function `bridgeBurn` in `L2GraphToken` could still be implemented by calling `_burn` directly (see item "The funcion `bridgeBurn` could directly call `_burn` in `L2GraphToken`" in my Gas Optimizations report), since OpenZeppelin `ERC20` already contains an internal burn mechanism through the `_burn(address account, uint256 amount)` function.
