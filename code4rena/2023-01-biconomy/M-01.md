# Loss of funds if mistakenly sent to the implementation contract 

The `SmartAccount` contract that is used as the implementation contract behind the Proxy defines the `receive` function.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccount.sol#L550

```solidity
receive() external payable {}
```

This will allow the implementation contract to receive ETH. 

## Impact

A user may mistakenly send funds to the implementation contract. These transactions will succeed, as the contract implements the `receive() payable` function.

Any ETH sent to the implementation contract will be lost, as this contract represents the implementation logic and not the proper user's wallet (the proxy).

## PoC

The following test illustrates the issue.

```solidity
contract AuditTest is Test {
    bytes32 internal constant ACCOUNT_TX_TYPEHASH = 0xc2595443c361a1f264c73470b9410fd67ac953ebd1a3ae63a2f514f3f014cf07;

    uint256 bobPrivateKey = 0x123;
    uint256 attackerPrivateKey = 0x456;

    address deployer;
    address bob;
    address attacker;
    address entrypoint;
    address handler;

    SmartAccount public implementation;
    SmartAccountFactory public factory;
    MockToken public token;

    function setUp() public {
        deployer = makeAddr("deployer");
        bob = vm.addr(bobPrivateKey);
        attacker = vm.addr(attackerPrivateKey);
        entrypoint = makeAddr("entrypoint");
        handler = makeAddr("handler");

        vm.label(deployer, "deployer");
        vm.label(bob, "bob");
        vm.label(attacker, "attacker");

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        implementation = new SmartAccount();
        factory = new SmartAccountFactory(address(implementation));
        token = new MockToken();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    
    function test_SmartAccount_SendEthToImplementation() public {
        address proxy = factory.deployWallet(bob, entrypoint, handler);
        SmartAccount wallet = SmartAccount(payable(proxy));

        uint256 amount = 1 ether;
        (bool sent,) = address(implementation).call{value: 1 ether}("");
        require(sent);

        assertEq(address(implementation).balance, amount);
        assertEq(address(wallet).balance, 0);
    }
}
```

## Recommendation

Remove  the `receive` function from the `SmartAccount` contract. The `receive` function should only be implemented in the `Proxy` contract.
