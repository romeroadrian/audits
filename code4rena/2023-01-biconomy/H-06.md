# Proxy creation isn't check in `deployWallet` function of `SmartAccountFactory` contract

The `deployWallet` function present in the `SmartAccountFactory` contract deploys a new wallet by creating a Proxy that points to a base implementation using assembly.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-biconomy/blob/main/scw-contracts/contracts/smart-contract-wallet/SmartAccountFactory.sol#L53-L61

```solidity
function deployWallet(address _owner, address _entryPoint, address _handler) public returns(address proxy){ 
    bytes memory deploymentData = abi.encodePacked(type(Proxy).creationCode, uint(uint160(_defaultImpl)));
    // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
    assembly {
        proxy := create(0x0, add(0x20, deploymentData), mload(deploymentData))
    }
    BaseSmartAccount(proxy).init(_owner, _entryPoint, _handler);
    isAccountExist[proxy] = true;
}
```

The call to create may fail, in which case the result of proxy will be 0. Citing [evm.codes](https://www.evm.codes/) from `CREATE` opcode section:

> Stack output  
> address: the address of the deployed contract, 0 if the deployment failed.

Since the result value of the create call isn't checked, the proxy creation can silently fail while the `deployWallet` function still succeeds.

## Impact

If the call to create fails, then the wallet (the Proxy itself) won't exist while the enclosing call to `deployWallet` will be successful.

Note that the call to `init` in line 59 will succeed too, since the `address(0)` has no code. Citing again [evm.codes](https://www.evm.codes/) from the `CALL` opcode section:

> Creates a new sub context and execute the code of the given account, then resumes the current one. Note that an account with no code will return success as true.

This means that the call to `deployWallet` will succeed and return the `address(0)` as the wallet's address. This will potentially cause loss of funds, as the user or any other integration may inadvertently send funds to this address.

## PoC

1. User calls `SmartAccountFactory.deployWallet` with valid parameters
2. Call to `create` on line 57 fails and returns 0.
3. Call to `init` on 59 still succeeds as the `address(0)` has no code.
4. Function terminates correctly, and returns `address(0)` as the result.

## Recommendation

Add a check to verify that the call to create succeeded (`proxy != address(0)`).

```solidity
function deployWallet(address _owner, address _entryPoint, address _handler) public returns(address proxy){ 
    bytes memory deploymentData = abi.encodePacked(type(Proxy).creationCode, uint(uint160(_defaultImpl)));
    // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
    assembly {
        proxy := create(0x0, add(0x20, deploymentData), mload(deploymentData))
    }
    require(proxy != address(0), "Create call failed");
    BaseSmartAccount(proxy).init(_owner, _entryPoint, _handler);
    isAccountExist[proxy] = true;
}
```
