# KYC parameters can be changed in the KYC variants of the Cash token and lock users out of their funds

The `CashKYCSender` and `CashKYCSenderReceiver` variants of the CASH token restrict transfers to senders or receivers that have a valid KYC status according to the KYC registry and the requirement group.

However, these two parameters are mutable and can be changed at any time by a privileged account with the corresponding access role.

## Impact

Any change in the KYC registry or the KYC requirement group will leave all current users that have a valid KYC status in the current registry and group locked out of their funds.

Since KYC statuses are tied to a particular registry and group, changing any of these two parameters will result in transfers being reverted due to the constraints placed in the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook.

## PoC

The following test illustrates the issue using the `CashKYCSender` token.

```solidity
contract TestAudit is BasicDeployment {
    function test_CashKYCSender_ChangeRegistry() public {
        createDeploymentCashKYCSender();

        // Add alice to current KYC registry
        _addAddressToKYC(kycRequirementGroup, alice);

        // Provide alice with CASH tokens
        _addAddressToKYC(kycRequirementGroup, guardian);
        vm.prank(guardian);
        cashKYCSenderProxied.mint(alice, 100e18);

        // Alice can transfer tokens
        vm.prank(alice);
        cashKYCSenderProxied.transfer(address(1), 1e18);

        // Deploy a new registry and change it in the token
        deployKYCRegistry();
        vm.startPrank(guardian);
        cashKYCSenderProxied.grantRole(cashKYCSenderProxied.KYC_CONFIGURER_ROLE(), guardian);
        cashKYCSenderProxied.setKYCRegistry(address(registry));
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Alice can't transfer anymore
        vm.prank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert();
        cashKYCSenderProxied.transfer(address(1), 1e18);
    }
}
```

## Recommendation

Remove the mutability of the KYC registry and KYC requirement group variables, and make them immutable by removing the setters.

Particular users can still be removed from the registry or changed from group if needed.
