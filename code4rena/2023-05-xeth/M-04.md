# CVXStaker cannot recover ETH

The `CVXStaker` contract contains a function to recover ERC20 tokens but fails to consider ETH.

## Impact

The `CVXStaker` contract contains a safeguard function to recover any ERC20 token which may incorrectly be sent to the contract or missed to be considered in the integration with Convex. This is present in the function `recoverToken()`:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-xeth/blob/main/src/CVXStaker.sol#L101-L109

```solidity
101:     function recoverToken(
102:         address token,
103:         address to,
104:         uint256 amount
105:     ) external onlyOwner {
106:         IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);
107: 
108:         emit RecoveredToken(token, to, amount);
109:     }
```

However, the implementation fails to consider ETH, as the `recoverToken()` can only be used for ERC20 tokens.

## Recommendation

```solidity
function recoverETH(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    payable(to).transfer(amount);
}
```
