# ETH payout in `PA1D` contract could always fail if at least one receiver reverts

## Impact

The `_payoutEth` function present in the `PA1D` contract sends ETH payments to all registered payout addresses using the `transfer` function of the `address` type, which is limited to 2300 units of gas and reverts if the transfer fails. 

If any of the receivers reverts (due to insufficient gas or because the receiver reverts) then the whole function will revert and it will be impossible for anyone to withdraw the ETH.

This may lead to an intentional or accidental denial attack where the function gets stuck and nobody can execute it.

See https://www.kingoftheether.com/postmortem.html for a detailed description of a similar issue.

## Proof of Concept

- A very simple contract that reverts on `receive` can trigger the denial attack:

```
contract DenyPayment {
  receive() external payable {
    revert();
  }
}
```

- A contract that (inadvertently) needs more than 2300 unit of gas to execute the receive (or fallback) function:

```
contract HighGasUsageOnPayment {
  receive() external payable {
    // some code that needs more than 2300 units of gas
  }
}
```

- It could also be a wallet implemented using smart contracts, see the postmortem linked above in which they mention the Mist wallet.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a "pull" pattern where the responsibility of transferring the ETH is shifted to that particular account instead of making it part of the whole process (see https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html). In this case, distributed balances could be accumulated in storage and then pulled by the account corresponding to payout addresses.
