# ERC20 and ERC721 base contracts have a non-reverting `receive` function

## Impact

The contracts `ERC20H` and `ERC721H`, which according to the docs are base implementations for holographable ERC20 and ERC721, have an empty payable `receive` function that would allow anyone to send ETH payments to these contracts.

The dev note reads "Defined here to suppress compiler warnings", but instead of adding a `revert()` to prevent this function from being called, the implementation is empty which would allow these contracts to receive transactions with value (and empty calldata).

This is particularly concerning because an end user may mistakenly send ETH to the contract and the transaction won't be reverted. These are base contracts intended for construction on top of the protocol, and when inherited they will also inherit this `receive` implementation.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the `receive()` function or, if it's needed to suppress the linting warning, include a `revert();` statement to revert the transaction.
