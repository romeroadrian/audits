# The function `getDeploymentBlock()` in the `Holographer` contract returns an incorrect data type

## Impact

The function `getDeploymentBlock()` present in the `Holographer` contract returns an `address`, while everything indicates that the underlying value holds a `uint256` that represents a block number, and even the function is named after that. This is caused because the contract uses unstructured storage and the slot value is sloaded directly into an `address` type, and could make integrations with this code fail, or even truncate the returned value since the address type is 20 bytes long.

The error is also present in the interface `HolographerInterface`.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

The return type in the contract and interface should be changed to `uint256`.
