# Wrong parameter is sent in the `onERC721Received` hook of the `HolographERC721` contract

## Impact

The `safeTransferFrom` function present in the `HolographERC721` contract calls the `onERC721Received` hook in the receiver with the wrong address in the first argument. The argument should match the operator (which is the one calling the transfer function) and instead the implementation is sending the address of the contract (`address(this)`). Integration contracts that hook on this callback will be receiving the wrong information.

## Proof of Concept

Any contract that implements the `onERC721Received` expects the first argument to be the operator (the account that triggered the transfer) and not the address of the token contract.

```
contract SimpleERC721Receiver is ERC721TokenReceiver {
  function onERC721Received(
    address _operator,
    address _from,
    uint256 _tokenId,
    bytes calldata _data
  ) external returns (bytes4) {
    // _operator here should be the caller to the transfer function
    // not the address of the ERC721 contract!
    
    return ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector;
  }
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change `address(this)` to `msg.sender` in the first argument in the `onERC721Received` call (line 467).
