# Pseudorandomness could be abused to favor an operator

The pod and operator selection when a message is cross chained (function `crossChainMessage` of the `HolographOperator` contract) is chosen by calculating a pseudorandom value using the formula:

```
uint256 random = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(jobHash, _jobNonce(), block.number, block.timestamp)));
```

Since the job hash and nonce can be known in advance, the function can be executed in a specific block number such that random calculation favors a particular operator. Block timestamp is also malleable by miners.
