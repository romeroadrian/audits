# Packed variables can be overlapped when packing a job to storage in the `HolographOperator` contract

When a new cross chain message is received in the `crossChainMessage` function, the job is stored to be later processed by an operator in the `_operatorJobs` mapping by packing some variables inside a `uint256`. 

Variables that are packed after the others could overlap the variables defined in the higher bits if they exceed their intended size within the packed structure. 

For example, the `_operatorTempStorageCounter` is placed after the `pod` variable at bit 216. When this variable exceeds the 32 bits (note that this is a counter) it will start overlapping the bits of the `pod` placeholder. Other cases could happen with the block number and timestamp variables.
