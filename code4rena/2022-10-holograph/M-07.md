# Unclear usage of payable functions involved in the "bridge in" flow

The function `lzReceive` in `LayerZeroModule` is marked as payable but doesn't forward the value to the operator when calling `crossChainMessage`. The operator forwards the value to the bridge in the `executeJob` function (it first forwards the value to the `nonRevertingBridgeCall` function then this function forwards it again in the low level code in line 465), but this value corresponds to the value sent by the originator of the job execution (the operator in charge of this job) and isn't related to the event received in the `LayerZeroModule` contract.
