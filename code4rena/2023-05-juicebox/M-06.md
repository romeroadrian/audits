# Swaps in Uniswap V3 may be partial

Uniswap V3 pools may execute a swap partially, in which case it may leave an unhandled amount of WETH in the JBXBuybackDelegate contract.

## Impact

Swaps in Uniswap V3 can eventually be executed partially, if liquidity is not enough or if slippage tolerance is hit. This means that not all of the input token amount is consumed during the swap.

In the context of JBXBuybackDelegate, we can see this being a potential issue in the `uniswapV3SwapCallback()` callback:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-juicebox/blob/main/juice-buyback/contracts/JBXBuybackDelegate.sol#L216-L233

```solidity
216:     function uniswapV3SwapCallback(int256 amount0Delta, int256 amount1Delta, bytes calldata data) external override {
217:         // Check if this is really a callback
218:         if (msg.sender != address(pool)) revert JuiceBuyback_Unauthorized();
219: 
220:         // Unpack the data
221:         (uint256 _minimumAmountReceived) = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
222: 
223:         // Assign 0 and 1 accordingly
224:         uint256 _amountReceived = uint256(-(_projectTokenIsZero ? amount0Delta : amount1Delta));
225:         uint256 _amountToSend = uint256(_projectTokenIsZero ? amount1Delta : amount0Delta);
226: 
227:         // Revert if slippage is too high
228:         if (_amountReceived < _minimumAmountReceived) revert JuiceBuyback_MaximumSlippage();
229: 
230:         // Wrap and transfer the weth to the pool
231:         weth.deposit{value: _amountToSend}();
232:         weth.transfer(address(pool), _amountToSend);
233:     }
```

If `_amountToSend` (the positive delta value that indicates the amount of tokens that need to be transferred to the pool) is less than the value sent to the `didPay()` function (indicating a partial swap), then the implementation simply sends the required amount to the pool, and ignores any potential unused amount.

In this scenario, any unused amount of ETH will be lost in the delegate contract, as it is not consumed during the swap and is not returned to the payer.

## Recommendation

There are two alternatives to mitigate the issue. One is to revert the operation if `_amountToSend` is less than the original intended amount, `_data.amount.value`, during the callback to `uniswapV3SwapCallback()`. This will require to encode `_data.amount.value` in the `data` variable to make it available during the callback.

The other alternative is to return any unused funds to the payer. If a positive amount of WETH is present after the swap is executed, it can be returned to the original payer by transferring the token at the end of the `_swap()` function in JBXBuybackDelegate.

```solidity
uint256 leftover = address(this).balance;
if (leftover > 0) {
  Address.sendValue(_data.payer, leftover);
}
```
