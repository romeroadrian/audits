# Delegate should check that terminal is operating with ETH as the terminal token

The JBXBuybackDelegate implementation is only prepared to operate with ETH as the terminal token. The implementation should check that the JuiceBox terminal matches this case.

## Impact

Terminals in JuiceBox come in two flavors, one in which the terminal token is ETH ([`JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1`](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v3/blob/main/contracts/JBETHPaymentTerminal3_1.sol)) and another one that uses arbitrary ERC20 tokens ([`JBERC20PaymentTerminal3_1`](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v3/blob/main/contracts/JBERC20PaymentTerminal3_1.sol)).

The current implementation of the JBXBuybackDelegate delegate is only prepared to operate using ETH. It expects the terminal to send ETH in the `didPay()` callback and uses a Uniswap pool which should pair WETH with the project's token.

The delegate implementation should check that the terminal is operating using ETH and not using any ERC20 token.

## Recommendation

While being installed, check that the token terminal is ETH.

```solidity
  constructor(
      IERC20 _projectToken,
      IWETH9 _weth,
      IUniswapV3Pool _pool,
      IJBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal3_1 _jbxTerminal
  ) {
      projectToken = _projectToken;
      pool = _pool;
      jbxTerminal = _jbxTerminal;
      _projectTokenIsZero = address(_projectToken) < address(_weth);
      weth = _weth;
      
+     require(_jbxTerminal.token() == JBTokens.ETH, "Terminal must use ETH");
  }
```
