# Delegate doesn't verify payed ETH value matches amount in parameter

The JBXBuybackDelegate delegate fails to check that the sent ETH amount matches the value passed in the `amount` parameter.

## Impact

The payable `didPay()` function present in the delegate is called by forwarding ETH as callvalue and an amount of tokens that is specified in the `JBDidPayData` struct present in the parameter of the function (`_data.amount.value`).

However, the function doesn't verify that the value of ETH sent equals the amount of tokens present in the argument of the function. ETH could be lost if more value is sent than the specified amount in the parameter of the function, as the implementation then uses this value to operate.

## Recommendation

Make sure the forwarded ETH value equals the amount passed in the `JBDidPayData` struct parameter.

```solidity
function didPay(JBDidPayData calldata _data) external payable override {
    // Access control as minting is authorized to this delegate
    if (msg.sender != address(jbxTerminal)) revert JuiceBuyback_Unauthorized();
    
    require(msg.value == _data.amount.value);
    
    ...
```
