# Reward amounts are not checked to be correctly deposited

## Summary

Reward amounts are not checked when these are set up, potentially causing issues and race conditions when being claimed.

## Impact

Protocol authorities can configure rewards by specifying the weekly reward allocated for each period. This is present in the LiquidityMiningPath contract:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/canto_ambient/contracts/callpaths/LiquidityMiningPath.sol#L65-L81

```solidity
65:     function setConcRewards(bytes32 poolIdx, uint32 weekFrom, uint32 weekTo, uint64 weeklyReward) public payable {
66:         // require(msg.sender == governance_, "Only callable by governance");
67:         require(weekFrom % WEEK == 0 && weekTo % WEEK == 0, "Invalid weeks");
68:         while (weekFrom <= weekTo) {
69:             concRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][weekFrom] = weeklyReward;
70:             weekFrom += uint32(WEEK);
71:         }
72:     }
73: 
74:     function setAmbRewards(bytes32 poolIdx, uint32 weekFrom, uint32 weekTo, uint64 weeklyReward) public payable {
75:         // require(msg.sender == governance_, "Only callable by governance");
76:         require(weekFrom % WEEK == 0 && weekTo % WEEK == 0, "Invalid weeks");
77:         while (weekFrom <= weekTo) {
78:             ambRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][weekFrom] = weeklyReward;
79:             weekFrom += uint32(WEEK);
80:         }
81:     }
```

Both functions store the weekly rewards in the `concRewardPerWeek_` and `ambRewardPerWeek_` mappings, but neither of these actually check that the contract is receiving or has the needed funds to distribute these.

Rewards are eventually claimed for past weeks using `claimConcentratedRewards()` or `claimAmbientRewards()`. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-canto/blob/main/canto_ambient/contracts/mixins/LiquidityMining.sol#L192-L195

```solidity
192:         if (rewardsToSend > 0) {
193:             (bool sent, ) = owner.call{value: rewardsToSend}("");
194:             require(sent, "Sending rewards failed");
195:         }
```

If the contract doesn't have the needed funds, the transfer will fail. This will prevent users from claiming their rewards or create a race condition for users to withdraw their rewards if the funds aren't enough to cover for all possible withdrawals.

## Recommendation

Check that `msg.value` is at least enough to cover for the specified reward periods.

```diff
    function setConcRewards(bytes32 poolIdx, uint32 weekFrom, uint32 weekTo, uint64 weeklyReward) public payable {
        // require(msg.sender == governance_, "Only callable by governance");
        require(weekFrom % WEEK == 0 && weekTo % WEEK == 0, "Invalid weeks");
+       require(msg.value >= (weekFrom - weekTo + 1) * weeklyReward);
        while (weekFrom <= weekTo) {
            concRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][weekFrom] = weeklyReward;
            weekFrom += uint32(WEEK);
        }
    }
    
    function setAmbRewards(bytes32 poolIdx, uint32 weekFrom, uint32 weekTo, uint64 weeklyReward) public payable {
        // require(msg.sender == governance_, "Only callable by governance");
        require(weekFrom % WEEK == 0 && weekTo % WEEK == 0, "Invalid weeks");
+       require(msg.value >= (weekFrom - weekTo + 1) * weeklyReward);
        while (weekFrom <= weekTo) {
            ambRewardPerWeek_[poolIdx][weekFrom] = weeklyReward;
            weekFrom += uint32(WEEK);
        }
    }
```

Alternatively, it could be possible to check if the contract holds the required funds (by inspecting address(this).balance). However, caution must be exercised when using this approach, as the contract's stored funds should also account for other previously configured periods.
