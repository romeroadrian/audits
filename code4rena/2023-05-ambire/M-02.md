# `deployAndExecute()` function in Factory should be payable

The `deployAndExecute()` function fails to consider ETH payments that may need to be forwarded to the wallet's `execute()` function.

## Impact

The `deployAndExecute` function present in the AmbireAccountFactory can be used to execute a bundle while also deploying the counterfactual wallet in case its deployment is still pending.

https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/blob/5c54f8005e90ad481df8e34e85718f3d2bfa2ace/contracts/AmbireAccountFactory.sol#L24-L32

```solidity
24: 	function deployAndExecute(
25: 		bytes calldata code,
26: 		uint256 salt,
27: 		AmbireAccount.Transaction[] calldata txns,
28: 		bytes calldata signature
29: 	) external {
30: 		address payable addr = payable(deploySafe(code, salt));
31: 		AmbireAccount(addr).execute(txns, signature);
32: 	}
```

The function tries to deploy the wallet and then calls the `execute()` function of the AmbireAccount contract:

https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/blob/5c54f8005e90ad481df8e34e85718f3d2bfa2ace/contracts/AmbireAccount.sol#L135

```solidity
function execute(Transaction[] calldata txns, bytes calldata signature) public payable {
  ...
```

As we can see in the previous snippet of code, the `execute()` function is `payable`, as the wallet may need to receive ETH funds in order to operate. However, `deployAndExecute()` fails to consider this as the function doesn't implement the `payable` modifier. Therefore, bundles executed through the `deployAndExecute()` function will be unable to receive ETH funds and utilize them in the included set of transactions.

## Recommendation

Add the `payable` modifier to the `deployAndExecute()` and forward the callvalue to the `execute()` function.

```solidity
    function deployAndExecute(
        bytes calldata code,
        uint256 salt,
        AmbireAccount.Transaction[] calldata txns,
        bytes calldata signature
@   ) external payable {
        address payable addr = payable(deploySafe(code, salt));
@       AmbireAccount(addr).execute{value: msg.value}(txns, signature);
    }
```
