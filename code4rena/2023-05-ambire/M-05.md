# AmbireAccount should provide a function to allow to cancel current nonce

The AmbireAccount implementation should provide a function to allow a privilege to cancel the current nonce.

## Impact

Transactions in the AmbireAccount depend on the state of the nonce. Privileges can authorize a bundle to be executed in the context of the wallet by signing a hash that includes the value of the nonce.

A user may decide to cancel their signed operation. If the bundle has been already signed and shared, then the user loses control over its execution, as anyone can submit it. 

The implementation should allow a privilege to cancel signed bundles whose execution is pending. This is a fairly straightforward and easy addition as simple stepping the nonce should work.

## Recommendation

Add a function to let authorized accounts step the nonce in order to invalidate potentially signed bundles with the current nonce.

```solidity
function cancelCurrentNonce() external {
    require(privileges[msg.sender] != bytes32(0), 'INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE');
    nonce += 1;
}
```
