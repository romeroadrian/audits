# Callee can intentionally make caller spend more gas than specified in `tryCatchLimit()`

While calls in `tryCatchLimit()` are bound by a defined gas limit, more gas may be spent while handling the result of the external call.

## Impact

The `tryCatchLimit()` function allows to the user to execute a call on behalf of the wallet with a certain gas limit. 

https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/blob/5c54f8005e90ad481df8e34e85718f3d2bfa2ace/contracts/AmbireAccount.sol#L126-L130

```solidity126: 	function tryCatchLimit(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data, uint256 gasLimit) external payable {
127: 		require(msg.sender == address(this), 'ONLY_IDENTITY_CAN_CALL');
128: 		(bool success, bytes memory returnData) = to.call{ value: value, gas: gasLimit }(data);
129: 		if (!success) emit LogErr(to, value, data, returnData);
130: 	}
```

While the external call itself is bounded by the `gasLimit` parameter, it is important to note that handling the result of the call also consumes gas which is not subject to the mentioned limit. Line 128 copies all of the return data into memory, and that data is also emitted in an event if the call is unsuccessful (line 129).

The callee can accidentally or intentionally return a big payload which would incur in heavy gas costs that are not bound by the intended gas limit in `tryCatchLimit()`. This is known as "return bombs" and is very well detailed in [this excellent article](https://www.notonlyowner.com/research/message-traps-in-the-arbitrum-bridge).

## Recommendation

One possible solution would be to impose the gas limit on the call to `tryCatchLimit()` itself, i.e. do something like `tryCatchLimit{gas: gasLimit}(...)`. However this would require some design changes and could probably be better refactored to include the gas limit value as part of the `Transaction` struct.

An alternative would be to use the [ExcessivelySafeCall](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/ExcessivelySafeCall) library (or implement something similar to that library) which basically bounds the size of the return data that is copied.
