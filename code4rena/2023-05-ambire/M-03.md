# Project may fail to be deployed to chains not compatible with Shanghai hardfork

Current settings may produce incompatible bytecode with some of the chains supported by the protocol.

## Impact

The Ambire wallet supports and targets different chains, such as Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. This information is available in [their website](https://www.ambire.com/).

All of the contracts in scope have the version pragma fixed to be compiled using Solidity 0.8.20. This [new version of the compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.20) uses the new PUSH0 opcode introduced in the Shanghai hard fork, which is now the default EVM version in the compiler and the one being currently used to compile the project.

Here is an excerpt of the bytecode produced for the AmbireAccount contract in which we can see the presence of the PUSH0 opcode(full bytecode can be found in the file `artifacts/contracts/AmbireAccount.sol/AmbireAccount.json`):

This means that the produced bytecode for the different contracts won't be compatible with the chains that don't yet support the Shanghai hard fork.

This could also become a problem if different versions of Solidity are used to compile contracts for different chains. The differences in bytecode between versions can impact the deterministic nature of contract addresses, potentially breaking counterfactuality.

## Recommendation

Change the Solidity compiler version to 0.8.19 or define an evm version that is compatible across all of the intended chains to be supported by the protocol (see https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/solidity-compiler?highlight=evm_vers#evm_version).
