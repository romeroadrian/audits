# EIP-712 signatures are not properly implemented

EIP-712 type of signatures supported by the SignatureValidator contract are wrongly implemented.

## Impact

The SignatureValidator contract is in charge of providing an implementation for different types of signature modes. Among these is the case of EIP712 mode, which should follow [the standard defined in EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712). The implementation for this mode simply decodes the r, s and v signature parts and calls `ecrecover` over the `hash` parameter:

https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/blob/5c54f8005e90ad481df8e34e85718f3d2bfa2ace/contracts/libs/SignatureValidator.sol#L53-L61

```solidity
53: 		if (mode == SignatureMode.EIP712 || mode == SignatureMode.EthSign) {
54: 			require(sig.length == 66, 'SV_LEN');
55: 			bytes32 r = sig.readBytes32(0);
56: 			bytes32 s = sig.readBytes32(32);
57: 			uint8 v = uint8(sig[64]);
58: 			if (mode == SignatureMode.EthSign) hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked('\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32', hash));
59: 			address signer = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s);
60: 			require(signer != address(0), 'SV_ZERO_SIG');
61: 			return signer;
```

However, the implementation of the AmbireAccount contract builds this hash by simply concatenating the address of the wallet, the chain identification, the nonce and the transactions:

https://github.com/AmbireTech/ambire-common/blob/5c54f8005e90ad481df8e34e85718f3d2bfa2ace/contracts/AmbireAccount.sol#L138

```solidity
138: 		bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encode(address(this), block.chainid, currentNonce, txns));
```

This doesn't conform to the EIP-712 at all, which defines a very strict set of rules over how the structured data is hashed and signed. There are several things wrong here:

1. The address of the contract and the chainId should be specified in a domain separator.
2. The hash should include a type definition of the data in the form of a `typeHash`.
3. Finally the hash should be composed of a "\x19\x01" prefix, then the hash of the domain separator, then the typehash, and finally the hash of the data (the nonce and the transactions).

## Recommendation

EIP-712 signatures should be properly implemented according to [the proposed standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712). The signature should be composed of the `domainSeparator`, which includes the name, version, chainId and the address of the contract, a typehash of the data (which in this case is an array of `Transaction` struct) and the hashed data itself that would contain in this case the nonce and the actual array of transactions.
