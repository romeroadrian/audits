## Comments

While the issue mentioned in M-02 has been technically mitigated, the same attack can be performed in another function present in the wallet.

The report describes an attack in which a malicious relayer can force the failure of calls to `tryCatch`. The issue in this specific function has been mitigated, however the same attack can be performed in the function `tryCatchLimit`. This new issue is expanded in [adriro-NEW-M-01].
