# Mitigation of M-04: Issue mitigated

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ambire-findings/issues/12

## Comments

The files in scope have been changed to use Solidity `0.8.19`, which doesn't use the new Shanghai fork as the default. Note that it is possible to use `0.8.20` while also targeting a different EVM version (see https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/compile-contracts#configuring-the-compiler).
