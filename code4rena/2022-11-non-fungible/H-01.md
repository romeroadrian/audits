# ETH payments may fail to be refunded and will be lost in the Exchange contract

The function present in the Exchange contract that is in charge of refunding any remaining ETH after a single/bulk exchange doesn't check the return value of the ETH transfer operation and may fail while the overall process succeeds.

## Impact

The `_returnDust()` internal function is called in the `execute` and `bulkExecute` functions of the Exchange contract to return the sender any ETH that is leftover after the exchanges happened.

This function uses a low level call using inline assembly to refund the caller if the storage variable `remainingETH` (which tracks the consumption of ETH) is greater than 0. The issue is that this function doesn't check if the low level call succeeded, the result of the call is stored in the variable `callStatus` but no further is done using this value.

If the caller is a contract, there are various reasons why this call may fail. The calling contract may fail to implement the receive/fallback callbacks, have an error during execution of the callback, or simply run out of gas. Any of these scenarios may cause the low level call to fail, the ETH won't be refunded and will be lost in the Exchange contract.

## PoC

This test reproduces the issue using a simple contract that initiates the purchase for demonstration purposes.

```
it('fails to refund eth', async function() {
  const buyerContract = (await simpleDeploy('NftBuyer', [exchange.address])) as any;
  const price = ethers.utils.parseEther("1");

  sell = generateOrder(alice, {
    side: Side.Sell,
    tokenId,
    paymentToken: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    price,
    fees: [],
  });

  buy = generateOrder(buyerContract, {
    side: Side.Buy,
    tokenId,
    price,
    paymentToken: ethers.constants.AddressZero,
    fees: [],
  });

  sellInput = await sell.pack();
  buyInput = await buy.packNoSigs();

  // buyer sends more eth than needed (double)
  await waitForTx(
    buyerContract.buyNft(sellInput, buyInput, { value: price.mul(2) })
  );
  
  // we bought the nft
  expect(await mockERC721.balanceOf(buyerContract.address)).to.eq(1);
  
  // ETH not refunded to buyer contract
  expect(await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(buyerContract.address)).to.eq(0);
  
  // ETH is in exchange
  expect(await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(exchange.address)).to.eq(price);
});
```

        exchange = _exchange;
    }

    function buyNft(Input calldata sell, Input calldata buy) external payable {
        exchange.execute{value: msg.value}(sell, buy);
    }

        exchange.bulkExecute{value: msg.value}(executions);
    }

    function onERC721Received(
        address,
        address,
        uint256,
        bytes calldata
    ) external returns (bytes4) {
        return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;
    }

    receive() external payable {
        // simulate a high gas operation
        while(true) {}
    }
}
```

## Recommendation

Verify the return value of the low level call in the `_returnDust()` function. If the result value `callStatus` isn't 1 (success) then revert the whole operation.
