# Pool contract uses proxies but doesn't implement the initializer function

The Pool contract uses proxies (OpenZeppelin UUPSUpgradeable) but doesn't include an initializer function to properly initialize the contract.

## Impact

The Pool contract inherits from `OwnableUpgradeable` to handle access protection for the contract but fails to initialize it, because the contract doesn't even have an initializer.

This will cause the internal `_owner` storage variable to remain uninitialized, its value will be empty/zero, and will leave the contract without owner. 

This is concerning in particular because the function that authorizes an upgrade `_authorizeUpgrade` is owner protected using the `onlyOwner` modifier, which will always be false since the owner is not initialized (owner is `address(0)`) and will prevent the contract from being upgraded.

## PoC

The following test uses the hardhat plugin `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades` to simplify the code. 

Note: `PoolV2` here is just the same code as the `Pool` contract with an added function, its contents aren't relevant to the test.

```
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers, upgrades } = require("hardhat");

describe.only("Pool", function () {
  it("deploys proxy", async function() {
    const Pool = await ethers.getContractFactory("Pool");
    const PoolV2 = await ethers.getContractFactory("PoolV2");

    const pool = await upgrades.deployProxy(Pool, []);
    await pool.deployed();

    // pool has no owner
    expect(await pool.owner()).to.eq(ethers.constants.AddressZero);

    // pool can't be upgraded
    await expect(
      upgrades.upgradeProxy(pool.address, PoolV2)
    ).to.be.revertedWith("Ownable: caller is not the owner");
  });
});
```

## Recommendation

Add a proper initializer to the contract that calls the `OwnableUpgradeable` initializer:

```
function initialize() external initializer {
    __Ownable_init();
}
```

Also, don't forget to lock initializers in the implementation contract:

```
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
