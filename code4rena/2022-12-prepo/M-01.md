# Collateral can be easily stolen by hacked or malicious protocol owners

The `Collateral` contract stores base tokens deposited as collateral in the protocol.

The contract contains a function `managerWithdraw` what would an account with the `MANAGER_WITHDRAW_ROLE` to withdraw any amount of funds from the contract:

https://github.com/prepo-io/prepo-monorepo/blob/feat/2022-12-prepo/apps/smart-contracts/core/contracts/Collateral.sol#L80-L83

```solidity
function managerWithdraw(uint256 _amount) external override onlyRole(MANAGER_WITHDRAW_ROLE) nonReentrant {
  if (address(managerWithdrawHook) != address(0)) managerWithdrawHook.hook(msg.sender, _amount, _amount);
  baseToken.transfer(manager, _amount);
}
```

A potentially attached `ManagerWithdrawHook` can minimize the size of the attack and the amount of withdrawn tokens, but it also relies on a `minReservePercentage` configurable variable by the protocol owners which can be set to 0 to nullify the minimum reserve amount that should be kept.

https://github.com/prepo-io/prepo-monorepo/blob/feat/2022-12-prepo/apps/smart-contracts/core/contracts/ManagerWithdrawHook.sol#L17

```solidity
function hook(address, uint256, uint256 _amountAfterFee) external view override { require(collateral.getReserve() - _amountAfterFee >= getMinReserve(), "reserve would fall below minimum"); }
```

The `minReservePercentage` can be set to 0 which will make `getMinReserve()` return 0.

https://github.com/prepo-io/prepo-monorepo/blob/feat/2022-12-prepo/apps/smart-contracts/core/contracts/ManagerWithdrawHook.sol#L29-L33

```solidity
function setMinReservePercentage(uint256 _newMinReservePercentage) external override onlyRole(SET_MIN_RESERVE_PERCENTAGE_ROLE) {
  require(_newMinReservePercentage <= PERCENT_DENOMINATOR, ">100%");
  minReservePercentage = _newMinReservePercentage;
  emit MinReservePercentageChange(_newMinReservePercentage);
}
```

Note that these roles are also assignable by the admin (`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` in OZ AccessControl contract) so any admin can also grant to themselves the required permissions to pull the attack.

## Impact

Hacked or malicious manager or protocol owner can steal all base tokens from the collateral contracts.

## Recommendation

There should be stronger immutable guarantees to limit how much a manager can withdraw and at what stage. 

## Judging Note

The status quo regarding significant centralization vectors has always been to award Medium severity, in order to warn users of the protocol of this category of risks. See [here](https://gist.github.com/GalloDaSballo/881e7a45ac14481519fb88f34fdb8837) for list of centralization issues previously judged.
