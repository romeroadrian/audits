# Mitigation of H-07: Mitigation error, see comments

## Comments

The issue described in H-07 is about a missing validation while burning RETH for ETH in the `withdraw()` function of the Reth derivative. 

## Technical Details

The proposed mitigation introduces a `canWithdrawFromRocketPool()` function to add the check to see if there is enough liquidity to call `burn()`:

https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/smart-contracts/pull/258/files#diff-6abc8f2e4ad1647a12784e9fbf18e9c5f86c05668e3e89e2a51ab569992b214fR92-R108

```solidity
function canWithdrawFromRocketPool(
    uint256 _amount
) private view returns (bool) {
    address rocketDepositPoolAddress = RocketStorageInterface(
        ROCKET_STORAGE_ADDRESS
    ).getAddress(
            keccak256(
                abi.encodePacked("contract.address", "rocketDepositPool")
            )
        );
    RocketDepositPoolInterface rocketDepositPool = RocketDepositPoolInterface(
            rocketDepositPoolAddress
        );
    uint256 _ethAmount = RocketTokenRETHInterface(rethAddress())
        .getEthValue(_amount);
    return rocketDepositPool.getExcessBalance() >= _ethAmount;
}
```

As we can see in the previous snippet, the function uses `getExcessBalance()` to implement the check, which is not accurate, as the condition should not only check for the excess balance but also for the available ETH balance in the contract. This can be seen in the implementation of `getTotalCollateral()`:

https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool/blob/master/contracts/contract/token/RocketTokenRETH.sol#L72C1-L75

```solidity
function getTotalCollateral() override public view returns (uint256) {
    RocketDepositPoolInterface rocketDepositPool = RocketDepositPoolInterface(getContractAddress("rocketDepositPool"));
    return rocketDepositPool.getExcessBalance().add(address(this).balance);
}
```

The pull request also adds RocketSwapRouter as a fallback mechanism if the collateral amount is not enough. However, RocketSwapRouter already considers burning RETH through the Rocket Pool protocol as part of its internal implementation (see implementation of `swapFrom()` here https://etherscan.deth.net/address/0x16D5A408e807db8eF7c578279BEeEe6b228f1c1C#code). This means that RocketSwapRouter could be used directly to provide a more optimal experience, as the implementation will try to first burn RETH and swap the rest using Uniswap or Balancer, minimizing slippage.

## Recommendation

Use directly the `swapFrom()` function of RocketSwapRouter, which will correctly use the burn mechanism of RETH, and swap the rest if the collateral doesn't cover the full amount. This will not only solve the issues, but also provide a more optimal solution.

## Out of scope

Low: note that RocketSwapRouter `swapFrom()` function will send ETH back to the contract, there is no need to unwrap the WETH:
