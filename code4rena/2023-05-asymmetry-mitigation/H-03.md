# Mitigation of H-03: See comments

## Comments

This issue and its associated duplicates describe the impossibility of removing a derivative, which may eventually derive in a protocol DoS at different levels if any derivative fails or its underlying protocol gets compromised.

The proposed change is to add a functionality to enable/disable derivatives, and skip the disabled ones in the implementation of the principal functions of the SafEth.sol contract. 

While I do think the issue is mitigated in the general scenarios described in H-03 and duplicated, I believe this change introduces new issues, which I'll describe in a separate report ([adriro-NEW-M-01]).
