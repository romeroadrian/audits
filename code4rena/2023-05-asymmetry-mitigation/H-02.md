# Mitigation of H-02: Issue mitigated

## Comments

The report mentions a potential case of two different price sources being used to calculate minted shares for the Reth derivative. 

This particular issue is correctly mitigated, as: 

1. Removes the confusing `_amount` parameter in the `ethPerDerivative()` function.
2. The `ethPerDerivative()` implementation in Reth.sol now uses a single price source, as opposed to before where two different paths could be taken depending on a condition.
