## Comments

Sponsor decided not to mitigate the issue with the following comment:

> This is as expected	

I agree that the issue is TOO broad and some of the described scenarios don't make sense at all (e.g. the approval while redeeming) or are highly unlikely (e.g. RockerPool returning a zero address). I would only consider the following:

1. SfrxEth staking pause. I've described this issue in MR for issue M-05.
2. Reth burn in the `withdraw()` function has been already addressed as part of the mitigation for issue H-07.
