## Comments

The sponsor decided to protect against the "inflation attack" by implementing internal accounting of balances, which prevents the donation of assets used to inflate the value of a share in the attack.

This is a common strategy used to mitigate this type of attack. However, it's important to note that this strategy isn't compatible with rebasing tokens. While the protocol currently doesn't support any derivatives that rely on rebasing tokens (stETH is a rebasing token, but it is used in the form of wstETH), this could become a problem if the protocol decides to integrate a new derivative that uses a rebasing token in the future.

Note: there is a debug import that should be removed here https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/smart-contracts/pull/282/files#diff-e500be4c081e76873145b6e38a37c2d59d6d57bd96cc581c3099582be79ba505R11
