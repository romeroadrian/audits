## Comments

This is the main issue related to MEV and oracle price manipulation attacks. As the issue is very broad in the sense that it covers all 3 derivatives, and it has 76 duplicates (https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry-findings/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aduplicate-142+is%3Aclosed), I will summarize the mitigation state given the proposed changeset, along with other changesets that impact this issue.

1. Reth has been changed to use Chainlink as the price feed. While this allows resistance to price manipulation, it introduces new issues which are described in [adriro-NEW-H-02].

2. The SfrxEth derivative still uses the Curve pool as the price oracle. However, the mitigation for issue H-04 (see https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/smart-contracts/pull/262/files) introduces a change that assumes a peg of frxETH to ETH. This in my opinion causes more harm than good, the potential problems are discussed in a separate report [adriro-NEW-H-01].

3. In the case of WstEth, the mitigation for H-06 (see https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/smart-contracts/pull/242/files) introduces Chainlink as the price oracle. However, similar to the case of Reth, this also introduces new errors which are described in [adriro-NEW-H-02].
