# Mitigation of H-05: Issue mitigated, see comments

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry-findings/issues/593

## Comments

The original issue talks about potential numerical problems while calculating the spot price using Uniswap V3 `sqrtPriceX96` in the Reth derivative.

The proposed change completely removes the feature to fetch the price from the Uniswap V3 pool (the `poolPrice()` function) in favor of using Chainlink as the price oracle.

The particular issue described in H-05 is mitigated as the logic to calculate the price from the Uniswap V3 pool is eliminated. However, the pull request introduces another issue, which is described in a separate report ([adriro-NEW-H-02]).
