# Mitigation of M-10: Issue not mitigated

Link to Issue: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry-findings/issues/363

## Comments

Even though the protocol team applied the warden's recommendation in M-10, the feature to enable/disable derivatives added as a mitigation for H-03/M-02/M-05 potentially reintroduces the issue.

## Technical details 

The following pull request https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/smart-contracts/pull/264/files adds a feature to enable or disable derivatives. As a result of this change, it is now possible to have at least one derivative, such that `derivativeCount > 0`, but have that derivative disabled.

Given this scenario, the added check in https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/smart-contracts/pull/208/files#diff-badfabc2bc0d1b9ef5dbef737cd03dc2f570f6fd2074aea9514da9db2fff6e4eR67 will succeed, while the deposit in the for-loop will be skipped as the derivative is disabled here https://github.com/asymmetryfinance/smart-contracts/pull/264/files#diff-badfabc2bc0d1b9ef5dbef737cd03dc2f570f6fd2074aea9514da9db2fff6e4eR86

This effectively reintroduces the conditions for the original issue described in M-10.

## Recommendation

The check should only consider enabled derivatives. Alternatively the check could be done using the `totalWeight` variable, as this variable considers only enabled derivatives, and will be zero if all derivatives are disabled.
